   Homer:       [meekly raises his hand]
   Supervisor:  I might have known it was you, Simpson.
   Homer:       But sir, I...
   Supervisor:  I don't want to hear about it Simpson, your fired!
                [looks up to catwalk]
                Oh, hi, girls!

 [End of Act One.  Time: 6:27]

 At breakfast, Lisa helps search through the classifieds.
   
   Lisa:  Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
   Homer: Those perfectionists, forget it.
   Lisa:  How about this, a supervising technician at the toxic waste dump.
   Homer: I'm no supervising technician, I'm a technical supervisor.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
   There there, Homer.  You'll find a job.  You've caused plenty of
   industrial accidents, and you've always bounced back.
   -- Marge, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 With the encouragement of the kids, Homer goes job-hunting.
 But everyone he approaches literally slams the door in his face.
 Wait a second, that last door was the Simpsons front door.
 The door opens.  Bart says, ``Don't give up Dad.''  He shuts it again.

 At Moe's Tavern...
   
   I'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much.
   -- Homer bemoans his lost job, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 The phone rings.
   
   Bart:  Is Mister Freely there?
   Moe:   Who?
   Bart:  Freely, first initials I. P.
   Moe:   Hold on, I'll check.  Uh, is I. P. Freely here?
          Hey everybody, I. P. Freely!
          [the customers laugh]
          Wait a minute...  Listen to me you lousy bum. When I get a
          hold of you, you're dead. I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Moe refuses to credit Homer another drink.  He explains why:
 ``I don't think your ever going to get another job and be able to
 pay me back.''

 Homer is unable to sleep.
   
   Marge:  Are you all right, Homer?
   Homer:  I'm fine, I'm just thinking.
   Marge:  I've been thinking, too.  You know Homer, you've always been such a
           good provider... but when we got married, even Mr. Burger promised I
           could come back to my old job any time I wanted.
   Homer:  You think you can still do that line of work?
   Marge:  Sure, you never forget.  It's just like riding a bicycle.
    :      [at a drive-in restaurant]
   Otto:   Hey Momma, where's my fries already!
    :      [Marge skates in, somewhat annoyed]
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Back at home, Homer lies unshaven on the couch.
   
   Lisa:   Dad!  Eat something!  [holds up a sandwich] It's got mustard on it.
    :      [Homer's eye view of the ceiling]
    :      [Bart leans in and waves his hand.  Lisa also leans in.]
   Bart:   All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
   Lisa:   I don't know what else to do.
   Maggie: [pokes Homer in the eye.  The picture fuzzes.]
   Bart:   There's only one thing we can do... take advantage of the old
           guy.  You've gotta sign my report card, Dad.
           [Bart takes Homer's hand and scrawls his name]
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Time passes...
   
   TV Announcer:  Loaf-time, the cable network for the unemployed, will be
           back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this.
   Duff Beer commercial:  Unemployed?  Out of work?  Sober?  You sat
           around the house all day, but now it's Duff time!  Duff, the beer
           that makes the days fly by!
   Homer:  Beer.  Now there's a temporary solution.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
   Beer.  Now there's a temporary solution.
   -- Homer, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Homer searches the fridge.  He pulls out a box, but it contains a cake
 which reads, ``Don't worry, Daddy, we love you anyway!''  Homer discards
 the cake, ``Damn!  I need money!''  Homer sneaks into Bart's bedroom
 and carefully snags the piggy bank without waking his son.
   
   [smashes open Bart's piggy bank with a hammer]
   Oh no!  What have I done?  I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank,
   and for what?  A few measly cents, not even enough to buy one beer.
   Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure... [counts] not even close.
   -- Homer, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 He reaches for the notepaper.  (``Dumb things I gotta do today''.)
 ``Dear Family.  I am an utter failure, and you'll be better off
 without me.  By the time you read this, I will be in my watery
 grave.  I can only leave you with the words my father gave me:
 Stand tall, have courage, and never give up.  I only hope I can
 provide a better model, in death than I did in life.  Warmest
 regards...''  He scratches that last part out.
 ``Love, Homer J. Simpson.''

 Homer takes one last look at the house.  With a rock tied to his
 waist, Homer heads out the gate (which he oils to keep the family
 from hearing the creaking) makes his way up the road.
 ``Nothing's easy'' he says to himself.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 11:50]
   
   Mrs. Winfield:  Looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself.
   Mr. Winfield:   Oh, maybe not.
                   Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk.
   -- Homer walks down the street with a rock tied to his waist,
      ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 The kids wake Marge thinking the house has been burgled.  Bart's
 piggy-bank and their father are missing.  Lisa finds the note.

 A speeding car almost knocks Homer over as he crosses the road.
 ``Hey, buddy!  Watch where you're going!''  He arrives at the bridge,
 and finds there a boulder just like the one he's been carrying.
 Bart calls out ``Don't do it, Dad!'', and Homer saves his family
 just in time from a speeding van.
   
   Homer:  Boy!  This intersection is dangerous.  Someone oughta put a
           stop sign here.  [a beam of sunlight graces Homer's face]
   Marge:  Oh, Homer, how could think of killing yourself?  We love you.
   Lisa:   Yeah, Dad, we love you.
   Bart:   Yeah!
    :      [during Homer's speech, the sun rises slowly in the distance]
   Homer:  Kill myself?  Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do.  Now
           I have a purpose, a reason to live.  I don't care who I have to
           face, I don't care who I have to fight, I will not rest until
           this street gets a stop sign!
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 At City Hall...
   
   Chief Wiggum:  Well it's no secret.  Our city is under siege by a
          graffiti vandal known as El Barto.  Police artists have a
          composite sketch of the culprit.  If anyone has any information,
          please contact us immediately.
   Bart:  [looking at the `Wanted' poster that shares only a slight resemblance]
          Cool man!
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Homer's submission for the council is next.
   
   Homer:  Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls,
           retired people with nothing better to do.  Danger comes in many,
           many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our caveman
           ancestors, to the...
   Esteemed Councilman:  Simpson!  Get to the point.
   Homer:  I think we should put a stop sign on D Street and Twelfth.  The
           other...
   Councilman:  All in favor [unanimously with the other councilmen] Aye.
           Approved, Meeting adjourned.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
   If they think I'm going to stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken!
   -- Homer becomes safety-conscious, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Homer makes the headlines.

 In the park, Marge and the kids pride themselves with what
 Homer's accomplished... but he's not so sure.
   
   Homer:  But come on, we all know this is small potatoes.  There's a
           danger in this town that is bigger than all the Dips put together.
   Lisa:   What, Dad?
   Homer:  I'm talking about <that>!  [points at the SNPP]
   Marge:  You mean your going to pick on your old bosses?
   Lisa:   Wow!
   Bart:   Gee, Dad's a hero.
   Homer:  Whadja say, son?
   Bart:   Nuthin'.
   Homer:  That's ok, I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 At a demonstration outside the gates of the SNPP.
   
   He also brought you the speed bump [cheer!]
   The dip sign  [cheer!]
   The fifteen mile per hour speed limit on Main Street [boo!]
   I give you the man whose very name is synonymous with safety:  Homer Simpson!

   Unlike most of you, I am not a nut.

 Surveyed from above...
   
   Burns:    Look at that man, he has the crowd in the palm of his hand.  I
             haven't seen anything like it since Jolson.  [to Smithers]
             Who is he?
   Smithers: That's Homer Simpson, sir.  He used to work here in the plant,
             but we fired him for gross incompetence.
   Burns:    Ah, so that's his little game.  Get this Simpson character up here
             right now.
   Smithers: But Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    I said do it, now DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Homer addresses the crowd.
   
   Your lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I,
   many of them incompetent boobs.
   I know this because I worked alongside them,
   gone bowling with them,
   watched them pass me over for promotions time and again.
   And I say... This stinks!
   -- Homer leads a demonstration at the SNPP, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
   Smithers:  Hey, Simpson, Burns wants to talk to you privately.
   Homer:     [still speaking through the megaphone] Privately?
   -- Homer leads a demonstration at the SNPP, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 He tells the crowd, ``Stay here.  I'll be right back.''

 Homer is brought to Burns' office.
   
   Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
   -- Monty Burns' famous words, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 Monty makes a generous offer.
   
   Burns: Hear me out Simpson!  I don't want you to come back as a technical
          supervisor, or supervising technician, or whatever the hell you
          used to be.  I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
   Homer: Safety?  But sir!  If truth be known, I actually caused more
          accidents around here than any other employee,  [leaning forward]
          including a few doozies no one every found out about.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 The offer expires in thirty seconds.  Burns starts an hourglass.
   
   Homer: [thinking to himself] Me in charge of safety?
          This place could blow sky-high.
          Naah, I'll concentrate on my work now.
          Hey, this guy's desk sure is big.
          I can't let Marge support the family!
          This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen.
          What should I...
   Burns: Simpson!  Time's up.
   Homer: What the hay, I'll take the job.
   -- A carefully-thought-out decision, ``Homer's Odyssey''
   
 ``Your first duty would be to step out on the balcony, and tell
 that crowd this plant is safe.''

 Homer goes out onto the balcony.  ``This plant is...''  His family look
 up at him.  ``Oh... sit tight, I'll be right back.''  The crowd cheers.
 Homer turns back into the office.
   
   Burns: You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise, just
          for your principles?
   Homer: Hmmmm, you put it that way it does sound a little far-fetched,
          but that's the lug your looking at... and I vow to continue
          spending every free minute I have crusading for safety.  Of
          course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me
          the job.
   Burns: You're not as stupid as you look, or sound, or our best testing
          indicates.
   -- ``Homer's Odyssey''
    When Marge expresses her concern over the legality of stealing cable,
 Homer gives her the pamphlet.
   
   Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies.
   Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less
         and are repeated ad nauseum.
   Hmm I don't know.
   -- Marge reads the `So you've decided to steal cable' pamphlet,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   TV:    Hear Me Roar, the Network for Women.
          In the next half-hour, we'll show you how to cut your first-aid
          bill in half by making your own band-aids.
   Marge: Ooh, that's a good idea.
   TV:    Now before we begin, you need five yards of sterilized cotton...

 The family enjoy their new toy, though eventually Homer is the only one
 left watching.
   
   Homer: Ooh, pro wrestling from Mexico.
          You know, down there, it's a <real> sport. ...
   Bart:  Ooh, this is where Jaws eats the boat. ...
          Ooh, this is where Die Hard jumps through the window. ...
          Ho ho, this is where Wall Street gets arrested, ha ha. ...
   TV:    ``Mr Speaker, if I could call your attention to the
          retroactive subsidy appropriations override bill,
          I refer you to page four thousand five hundred and...''

   TV:    ``Live, from New Orleans, this is the World Series of cock-fighting!
          Oh, son-of-a-gun, we'll have big fun on the Bayou tonight.'' ...

   -- Watching cable all night, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Marge reminds Homer to get ready for church.
   
   Rev. Lovejoy: Now, today's Christian doesn't think he needs God.  He thinks
          he's got it made.  He's got his hi-fi.  His boob tube.  And his
          instant pizza-pie.
   Homer: Ooh, pizza.  [licks his lips]
   -- Sunday sermon, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 At Sunday School...
   
   Miss Allbright:  Today's topic will be Hell.
   Kids:  Ooh.
   Bart:  All right. I sat through Mercy and I sat through Forgiveness.
          <Finally> we get to the good stuff.
   -- Sunday School, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Miss Allbright: Hell is a terrible place.  Maggots are your sheet, worms
         your blanket, there's a lake of fire burning with sulfur.  You'll
         be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  As a matter of fact,
         if you actually saw hell, you'd be so frightened, you would die.
   Bart: [raises his hand] Oh, Miss Allbright.
   M.A.: Yes, Bart.
   Bart: Wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?
   M.A.: No.
   Bart: [raises his hand]
   M.A.: Yes, Bart.
   Bart: Are there pirates in hell?
   M.A.: Yes.  Thousands of them.
   Bart: [rubs hands] Hoo hoo, baby!
   -- Sunday School, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Miss Allbright goes on to say that to avoid eternal damnation, you must
 obey the Ten Commandments.  Lisa is particular frightened by number 8:
 `Thou shalt not steal.'  In the car on the ride home...
   
   Marge:  So, what did you children learn about today?
   Bart:   Hell.
   Homer:  Bart!
   Bart:   But that's what we learned about.
           I sure as HELL can't tell you we learned about HELL
           unless I say HELL, can't I?
   Homer:  Well, the lad has a point.
   Bart:   Hell, yes!
   Marge:  Bart!
   Bart:   [singing] Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, ...
   Marge:  Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School.  Don't swear.
   -- Coming home from church, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Upon returning home, the family settle down to watch more television,
 though Lisa isn't so sure it's right.
   
   Troy:  Hello, I'm Troy McClure.  You may remember me from such movies as
          `Cry, Yuma' and `Here Comes the Coast Guard'!  But today I'd like
          to tell you about a pleasant-tasting candy that actually cleans
          and straightens your teeth!
   Homer: Oh, goodie!  A program-length advertisement!
   Woman: [methodically] Wait a minute, Troy.  I'm a little confused.
          Did you say, cleans <and> straightens?
   Troy:  There's no confusion, Tina.  Just good science.  Ladies and
          gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the inventor, Dr. Nick Riviera.

 seated on the sofa with the rest of the family.
   
   Satan:  Come on, Lisa.  Watch a little cable with us.  Heh heh.
           It won't cost you a thing ... EXCEPT YOUR SOUL!

 At the supermarket...
   
   Lisa:   Mom, what are you doing?
   Marge:  What, what do you mean?
   Lisa:   Don't you remember the eighth commandment?
   Marge:  Oh, of course.  It's thou shalt not um not covet, um,

   Lisa:   THOU SHALT NOT STEAL!!!
   -- Marge eats two grapes in the supermarket,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 As Lisa watches, Marge insists on paying for the two grapes at
 the register.  At home, Homer watches more television...

   someplace else ... We've got it!  On the Blockbuster Channel!
   -- TV advertisement, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Lisa:   Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?
   Homer:  [sotto voce] Oh, great...
           [speaking up] All right, what makes you say that?
   Lisa:   Well, in Sunday School, we learned that stealing is a sin.
   Homer:  Well, DUH.
   Lisa:   But everybody does it.
           I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.
   Homer:  Oh.  Look at this way, when you had breakfast this morning,
           did you pay for it?
   Lisa:   No.
   Homer:  And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
   Lisa:   No, I didn't.
   Homer:  Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker!  Before I call the Feds!
   Lisa:   Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
   Homer:  Well, thank you, honey.
   -- There, I've run rings around you logically,

   Karl: Yea, you wanna come over to my house and listen to round-by-round
         updates on the radio?
   Len:  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, and then after the fight, we can watch the
         still photos on the 11-o'clock news.
   Karl: Not too shabby!
   -- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Homer invites his coworkers to see the fight.  Burns snoops in on the
 security cameras.
   
   Um, he's Homer Simpson, sir.  One of your drones in sector 7-G.
   -- Smithers to Mr. Burns, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Burns says he'd even go to an employee's house to watch the fight.
   
   Smithers:  Permission to speak frankly, sir?
   Burns:     Permission granted.
   Smithers:  Well, you are quite wealthy, ...
   Burns:     Thank you, Smithers.  Your candor is most refreshing.
   -- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Smithers continues his sentence to ask why Burns doesn't just buy cable
 himself.  Burns says it's one of those occasions where he can relish
 `the sights, the sounds, and, ah yes, the smells of other men'.  Homer
 invites the gang at Moe's tavern to watch the fight.  He also invites Apu...
   
   I'll get my brother Sanjay to cover for me.  He deplores violence of all kinds.
   -- Apu excited about watching the upcoming fight,

   Lisa:  So even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family,
          that would be stealing?
   Rev.:  No.  Well, it is if he puts anything on it.  Jelly, for example.
   Lisa:  I see.
   -- A clarification from Reverend Lovejoy,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Rev. Lovejoy suggests that she set an example by refusing to watch the
 offending technology.  Meanwhile, Bart learns about the other channels
 available on cable...
   
   TV:    You're watching `Top Hat Entertainment'.  Adult programming
          all day, every day.  (Except in Florida and Utah.)
          Coming up next, `Stardust Mammaries'...
   Bart:  Aye, Carumba!
   Homer: Bart!
   Bart:  Dad!   [He didn't yell `Homer!']
   -- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel.  It's only for
   mommies and daddies who love each other very much.
   -- Homer catches Bart watching an adult cable channel,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Homer makes Bart promise never to watch that channel again.  Lisa comes home.
   
   Lisa:  Hi, Dad.
          I think stealing cable is wrong,
          so I am choosing not to watch it
          in the hopes that others will follow my example.
          That's the last you'll hear from me on the matter.

 Marge suggests that perhaps they should unhook the cable, but Homer
 refuses to part with it.  So Marge suggests they pay for it, and Homer
 explains, `Look, Marge, I can't afford it.  when I can afford to pay for
 it, I will, but I can't, so I'm not going to.'  (Ah, the song of a pirate.)

 man responds, ``Even better...''
   
   Marge, we can't be too careful.  There are thieves everywhere.
   And I'm not talking about the small forgiveable stuff.

 Bart invites his schoolmates to watch cable...
   
   Bart:     Come one, come all!  Top Hat Theater is on the air!
             The most beautiful women in the world!
             Just fifty cents!
             I am your host, Bart Simpson!
             (Must be at least eight years old to enter.)
   TV:       And now, the `Top Hat' channel is honored to present...
             `Broadcast Nudes'.
   Gang:     Oooooohh...
   Milhouse: Gross!
   Martin:   Yet strangely compelling...

 Homer catches them.
   
   Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
   -- Bart is caught watching a cable porn channel, [Burger King alert!]

 That evening, people arrive to watch the fight.
   
   Here, I brought some imported generic beer.
   -- Barney brings a gift, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Apu:   Oh, hello, Mrs. Homer.  I brought an assortment of jerkys.
   Homer: Oh, did you swipe those from work?
   Apu:   Certainly not.  What has been implied here?
   -- Apu arrives to watch the fight on Homer's stolen cable TV,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 The TV pre-fight hype replays an incident from earlier in the day.
 Lisa quietly announces...
   
   I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching
   this fight as my form of nonviolent protest.
   -- Lisa refuses to watch stolen cable,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 When Moe arrives, Homer frantically hides the mugs he swiped from
 Moe's Tavern...
   
   Hey, go protest outside, will ya?  Now!
   -- Homer yells at Lisa who simply stares at him,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 ... before opening the door.  Moe's gift is a mug from the tavern.
 Homer then sees Burns and Smithers coming up the walk.
   
   Homer: Quick, Bart!  Hide the stuff I borrowed from work!
   Bart:  Borrowed?
   Homer: All, right, that stuff I stole from work.
   -- Panicking when Mr. Burns arrives, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Will you quit staring at me like that!?
   -- Homer to Lisa who is staring innocently at Homer from outside,
      ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Burns arrives and gives Homer `some munchies', a tiny bag of Cheetos.
 Burns' appearance scares some of Homer's guests.  The next visitors are
 the two cops.
   
   Cop:   Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hookup.
   Homer: No!  No, I... It wasn't me.  It was my wife.  My wife's idea.
          Yeah, yeah, ...
   -- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 ... but they just want to watch the fight, too.  Outside, Marge brings
 Lisa some lemonade and moral support.

   they will do the right thing.

 The pre-fight hype profiles Dreaderick Tatum...
   
   Announcer: The challenger learned how to fight in the notorious province[?]
              of Capital City, and honed his skills while serving time for
              aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
   Barney:    Awright!  A local boy!
   Tatum:     For five years, I was incarcerated, away from my family, and
              the mothers [sic] of my children...
   -- Watching the pre-fight hype, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
 Hearing the list of charges against Tatum gives Homer the willies, and
 he envisions himself in jail, isolated from his family.  (He calls,
 ``Marge!  Lisa!  Maggie!''  Bart is conspicuously missing.)  As the
 fight begins, he drags Bart outside.
   
   I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know that
   I've made a couple of really important decisions.
   Number 1: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over, and
   Number 2: I'm not very fond of any of you.
   -- Homer, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''
   
   Lisa:  Dad, we may have saved your soul.

-- Episode: There is no disgrace like home

 After helping himself (and belching), he earns a scolding from Marge.
   
   Homer:  Are you sure that's enough?
           You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts!
   Marge:  Oh Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it... [indicates with her
           finger]  Once.
   Homer:  Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoke to me without using the
           word...  [dejectedly]  Bonehead.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone is in the car with a plate of delicious gelatin dessert on their
 laps.

 On arrival, the family (save Marge) carry the plates above their heads.
 Homer sets some ground rules with the kids.
   
   Homer:  Okay, now look.  My boss is going to be at this picnic, so I want
           you to show your father some love and/or respect.
   Lisa:   Tough choice.
   Bart:   I'm picking respect.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Mr. Burns welcomes the Gammel family.  When Gammel Jr.\ complains about
 missing little league, the father kindly tells his son to be quiet.
   
   Burns:    Oh please please, don't fight.  Just go out back and have a good
             time.  [to Smithers]  Fire that man Smithers, I don't want him, or
             his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.
   Smithers: He'll be gone by the tug-of-war sir.
   Burns:    Excellent.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The Simpsons arrive.
   
   Homer:    Ah, afternoon Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    Hello there... uh... uh...
   Homer:    [whispers to Smithers]  Simpson, Homer.
   Smithers: [hands an index card to Burns]  Here you go, sir.
   Burns:    Ah!  Oh yes... [reads the card]  Oh, and this must be your lovely
             wife... Marge.
   Marge:    [smiles]
   Burns:    Ho ho, look at little... uh... [consults the card]  Lisa!  Why,
             she's growing like a weed.
             And this must be... uh, Brat!

 Homer presents their delicious gelatin dessert.
   
   Oh, for the love of Peter!
   -- Monty Burns utters a frustrated expletive, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 It seems that ``some damned fool went around telling everyone that I loved
 that slimy goop!''  He instructs them to ``toss it on the pile over there,''
 indicating several rooms already filled with gelatinous dessert.
   
   Burns:  Make yourselves at home.
   Bart:   Hear that Dad?  You can lie around in your underwear and scratch
           yourself.
   Homer:  [angrily, he goes to strangle Bart]  Now you listen to me!
   Burns:  Trouble, Simpson?
   Homer:  [one hand around Bart's neck]  No, heh heh heh.  Just congratulating
           the son on a fine joke about his old man.  [nervously pats Bart's
           head]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Out the back of the estate, Homer stresses the importance of proper conduct
 with Bart and Lisa.
   
   Homer:  Now, remember!  As far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.
   Lisa:   Hey Bart!  Last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!
   Homer:  D'oh!  [chasing after the two]  Be normal!  Be normal!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 One of the other mothers recommends that they dump their adorable girls in
 the nursery and get a glass of punch, but Marge admits to not being much of
 drinker.  ``Is that your boy there torturing a swan?''  Marge suggests
 a glass of punch.  Homer is still chasing after Bart and Lisa (who
 is hiding in the fountain).  The two mothers enter a room where a group of
 small children are playing.
   
   Marge:   Do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
   Mother:  You're right.  [turns on the TV]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Outside, Homer continues his search for Bart and Lisa.  Lisa has disguised
 herself as a fountain cherub.

           you kids!  [Bart beans Homer with a rock]  Ow!

   Homer:  You remember the rules from last year?
   Bart:   Yeah, shut my mouth and let your boss win.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer drags Bart along to the event.  One of the swans has its revenge on
 Bart's behind.  The employees' wives are gathered around a bowl of punch.
   
   Mother:  I don't know who to love more...  My son Joshua who's
            captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber who got the lead
            in the school play.  Usually, I use their grades as a tie-breaker,
            but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
   Marge:   [helping herself to ample amounts of the punch]  Umm-hmm.  Well I
            sense greatness in my family.
   Mother:  <Your> family?
   Marge:   Well, it's a greatness that others can't see... but it's there, and
            if it's not <true> greatness we have, we're at <least> average.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   I don't want to alarm anyone, [woozily]  but I think there's a
   little al-key-hol in this punch.  [scoops another cupful]
   -- Marge enjoys some liquid refreshment at the company picnic,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The Father-Son sack race is ready to be run.
   
   Smithers: Mr. Burns, are you ready?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: Are you set?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: [whispers]  Go, Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    [feebly hops away]
   Smithers: [after Burns gets a healthy lead, fires the starter's pistol]
             (*bang*)
   -- The Father-Son sack race at the company picnic,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone cautiously stays a few leaps behind the man who can fire them.
 Bart grouses, ``Man, this is pathetic!  I'm going for it!''  Bart takes
 the lead, and Homer does a flying tackle to stop Bart just short of
 the finishing line.  Burns feebly hops to victory.  ``Close one this year.''

 Marge is at this point completely sloshed and leads the other mothers
 in a song.
   
   Marge:  Here we sit, enjoying the shade.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  Drink the drink that I have made.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  He's here with me, my one and only.
   Homer:  [runs past chasing the kids, sees Marge]  Huh?
   Marge:  Drink, my friends and don't be lonely.
   Homer:  [slaps his forehead] Oh!
   Wives:  Hey Marge, and pour the wine!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer goes to retrieve his wife.
   
   Homer:  Snap out of it Marge!  You've gotta come with me, the boss is going
           to make a toast.
   Marge:  Whoa, oh, I'm not much of a drinker.  [collapses]
   Homer:  You picked a perfect time to start, you... [Marge gazes at him]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Late afternoon, and everyone is gathered around the rotunda.  A marching band
 plays ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow''.
   
   Burns:    Musicians, cease that infernal tootling! [they do]
   Smithers: [hands Burns a card]
   Burns:    Thank you all.
   Smithers: [hands another card]
   Burns:    Ah... For coming.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The crowd applauds.  Marge keeps clapping, then apologizes to everyone
 (individually).
   
   Now it's time to say goodbye.
   Please get off my property until next year.
   I suggest you don't dawdle, the hounds will be released in ten minutes.
   -- Burns closes the company picnic, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 As the families leave, a son thanks his father for the good time he's had.
 Mr. Burns likes to see this kind of family unity and promotes the father.
   
   Homer:  Quick Bart, give me a kiss.
   Bart:   Kiss you?  But Dad, I'm your kid!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer pays Bart five dollars.  Bart takes the money and uncomfortably
 kisses his father.
   
   Burns:    Ugh, I've never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
   Smithers: Fabulous observation sir, just fabulous.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone walks back to their cars (except for Marge, who is flying Cloud-9)
 Homer congratulates the other father for his success with ``that corn-ball
 routine.''  Homer watches the other man's son politely opens the door for
 his sister, while Bart and Lisa fight to be the first in the car.
 As the `good' wife offers to drive her tired husband home, Marge thinks
 she's going to be sick.

 The other family (complete with halos and angelic wings) drive off,
 singing, ``There was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o...''
 He looks back at the demons that possess his family, with their sharp teeth
 and nails, elfin ears and fiery hair.  The surrounding country-side takes on
 a hellish glow.
   
   Marge:  Homey!  Get in the car!
   Lisa:   This is where you belong!
   Bart:   Yeah Homer, room for one more!
   Marge+Lisa+Bart: [chanting]  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They cackle sinisterly as Homer steps into the car and drives off into a
 landscape covered in lava and burning sulphur.  The blessed family ride home
 on their ``Roadway to Heaven''.  Homer sighs as the camera pulls back to
 show the interior of the car (everyone is back to normal), with Marge looking
 very sour.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:06]

 Dinnertime at the Simpsons.  Marge and the kids shovel food into their
 mouths while staring at the TV.  ``Unable to fend for themselves, the baby
 bald eaglets are dependent on their mother regurgitating the food.''
 This doesn't affect Bart and Lisa's appetites at all.  Homer enters,
 turns off the TV set, and insists, ``We're not going to shovel food into
 our mouths while we stare at the TV.  We're going to eat at the dining
 room table like a normal family.''

 The family are seated in the dining room.  Lisa asks, ``Happy, Dad?''
 Homer answers, ``Yes.''  Lisa concludes, ``Good, commence shoveling.''

 Homer stops everyone in mid-shovel and insists they say Grace.
   
   Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.
   -- Bart says Grace, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer stops him. ``Ignore the boy, Lord.''
   
   Homer:  Dear Lord, thank You for this microwave bounty, even though we
           don't deserve it.  I mean... our kids are uncontrollable hellions!
           Pardon my French... but they act like savages! [kids bewildered]
           Did You see them at the picnic?  Oh, of course You did... You're
           everywhere, You're omnivorous.
           Oh Lord!  Why did You spite me with this family?
   Marge and the kids:  Amen!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 With a shout of ``Let's eat!'' Bart and the family recommence shoveling.
   
   Homer:  Sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
   Marge:  Maybe we should move to a larger community.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   D'oh!
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Don't have a cow, Dad.
   -- Bart, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   The sad truth is, all families are like us.
   -- Lisa, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer begs to differ.  ``Well there's only one way to find out.''  He
 takes the family on a little excursion.

 The family crawl up to a neighbor's window and inside see a standard
 1950's television family having a banquet.
   
   Homer:  Look at that, kids!  No fighting, no yelling.
   Bart:   No belching.
   Lisa:   Their dad has a shirt on!
   Marge:  Look!  Napkins!
   Bart:   These people are obviously freaks.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer takes them to ``see what's behind door number two.''  The family
 see a family having a conversation.  ``They actually enjoy talking to
 each other,'' observes Marge.  The conversation?  The child says,
 ``I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.''  The father answers,
 ``I did too.  Better get the gun.''  The father appears at the front
 door with a shotgun.

 The Simpsons make their escape, then approach another window.
   
   Bart:   Whoa!  Look at this place, what a dump!
   Homer:  It's worst than you think, heh heh heh.  I just trampled this poor
           sap's flower bed.
   Marge:  Ho-mer, this is <our> house.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer lingers outside.
   
   I want to be alone with my thought.
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 At Moe's tavern, Homer has no interest in the boxing match.
 The two cops walk in.
   
   Moe:    Eddie!  Would you like some pretzels?
   Eddie:  No thanks, we're on duty.  A couple of beers would be nice though.
   -- The two cops pay a visit to Moe's Tavern, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They're investigating a family of peeping toms who have been terrorizing
 the neighborhood.  The police dog finds Homer and goes nuts, and the cops
 must remove the dog forcibly from the premises.
   
   You know Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.
   She said, ``Homer, you're a big disappointment'', and God bless her
   soul, she was really onto something.
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Barney: Don't blame yourself Homer.  You've got yourself a bad hand.  You've
           got crummy little kids that nobody can control.
   Homer:  You can't talk way about my kids!  Or at least two of them.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Barney asks, ``You got two that I haven't met?''\ and earns a fistful
 from Homer.  As the boxing match continues, Homer and Barney struggle
 on their own.  Barney floors Homer.  A commercial comes on, and Homer
 watches from floor-level.
   
   TV:      All-star Boxing was brought to you by ``Doctor Marvin Monroe's
            Family Therapy Center''.  [Dr. Marvin Monroe waves.]

   Husband: No-o-o... I don't think so.
   Wife:    Honey, you have a problem, and it won't get better until you admit it.
   Husband: I admit this...  You better shut your big yap!

 [End of Act 2.  Time: 11:45]

 Marge is with the kids watching an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.  Homer enters.
   
   Homer:  All right, time for a family meeting.  [shuts off the TV]
   Lisa:   Why can't we have a meeting when <you're> watching TV?
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Homer:  Now look... You know and I know this family needs help, professional
           help.  So I've made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.
   Bart:   The fat guy on TV?
   Lisa:   You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro-wrestling?
   Homer:  Boxing, Lisa, boxing.  There's a world of difference.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Marge is worried if this is this the right thing to do.
   
   Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study, and of all the commercials
   I saw, his was the best.
   -- Homer suggests the family see Dr. Marvin Monroe,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 And it costs only $250.  Marge tells him they don't have that kind of money.
 Homer commands her to bring out the kids' college fund.
   
   Oh come on Marge... Why skimp now on the off-chance that they'll
   actually get in someplace.
   -- Homer asks Marge to fetch the children's college fund,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Marge counts the contents of a smashed piggy-bank on the kitchen table.
 Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.  Homer's not licked yet.
   
   Homer:  To save this family we're gonna have to make the <supreme> sacrifice.
   Lisa:   No Dad!  Please don't pawn the TV!
   Bart:   Aw come on, Dad, anything but that!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Marge:  Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?
   Homer:  I appreciate that, honey,
           but we need one hundred an fifty dollars here!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They enter the pawn shop.  The clerk welcomes the family (by name).
   
   Homer:  [presenting TV]  Would you pay $150 for this <lovely> Motorola?
   Clerk:  Is it cable-ready?
   Homer:  As ready as she'll ever be.
   -- Pawn shop, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They have a deal.  At Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center, the family signs
 for their appointment with the receptionist.  ``My Love Is Blue'' plays in
 the background.
   
   Marge:  [despairingly] Homer, you raided the college fund, the TV... Homer,
           you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.
   Homer:  Hey!  No pain, no gain!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Receptionist:  Will you be paying by cash or check?
   Homer:  Cash of course!  I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here
           with me.  I'm holding it right now.  Here it is, look... check it
           out.  [Homer realizes he could be making a big mistake.]  Two hundred
           and fifty big ones.
   Bart:   You really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where
           our TV used to be.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 A family who resemble the Simpsons have concluded their therapy session, and
 go to express their new found ability to express love for each other with a
 round of frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Homer makes his decision, and hands
 the money over to the receptionist.  ``There go my young girl dreams of
 Vassar,'' muses Lisa.

 Dr. Marvin Monroe welcomes the Simpsons into his office.
   
   Monroe: Hello, I'm Doctor Marvin Monroe, no doubt you recognize me from TV.
   Lisa:   We would if we had one.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer shouts at Lisa, but Marvin Monroe tells Homer he mustn't stifle the
 youngster, that his family must be free to express itself.  Dr. Monroe
 hands them pads and jumbo markers to draw their fears, their anxieties,
 the roots of their unhappiness.  They take a deep cleansing breath, and
 begin.

 Bart shows a drawing of Homer.  Lisa, the same.  Marge likewise.  [Monroe:
 ``No surprises there.'']  Homer continues drawing, not paying attention to
 Dr. Monroe.  He draws a plane dropping a load of bombs.  Doctor Marvin
 Monroe concludes that the family views Homer as ``an ogre, if you will.''
 Bart's chimes his agreement, and Homer reaches for a lamp.  Doctor
 Monroe quickly takes possession of the lamp.
   
   Whoa!  Okay, so you want to kill each other.  That's good, that's
   healthy.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict.
   -- Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 He asks merely that they use his patented aggression therapy mallets,
 unlocking them from a gun-rack.  Said mallets consists of a steel rod
 padded with foam rubber.  After another deep cleansing breath, the
 Simpsons take it out on each other.
   
   Homer:  Wait a minute, these mallet things are padded with foam rubber.
           What's the point?
   Bart:   They work much better without the padding, Doc.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Over Marvin Monroe's protestations, Bart demonstrates his point by
 thwacking the doctor's shin.  Dr. Monroe angrily takes the steel rod
 from Bart and concludes that portion of the treatment.  Asks Marge,
 ``Are we cured yet?''  Monroe answers, ``No!  Don't be ridiculous.''
 He requires somewhat more unorthodox methods.  ``I'll have plenty of
 time to explain while I warm up the...  Electric generator.''

 In another room, the family sit with metal straps attached to their head and
 arms, and a console with four button in front of each of them.
   
   Monroe: Everyone comfy?  Hmmph, good.  Now don't touch any of those buttons
           in front of you for a very important reason.  I.e., You are wired in
           to the rest of your family.  You have the ability to shock them, and
           they have the ability to shock---(*buzzzzzz*)
   Homer:  Waaaaaaugh!
   Bart:   Just testing.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer is about to press a button, but Monroe holds his arm back.
   
   Monroe: This is what's known as aversion therapy.  When someone hurts you
           emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will
           learn not to hurt each other at all!  And won't that be wonderful
           Homer?
   Homer:  Oh yes, doctor!  [zaps Bart]
   Bart:   Oh!  [presses button]
   Lisa:   Owwww!
   Marge:  [scornfully]  Bart!  How could you shock you little sister?
   Bart:   My finger slipped.  [zapped]  Whaaaaagh!

   Homer:  There's only one thing worse than being a loser.  It's being one
           of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of how he became
           a loser, and I never want that to happen to me.

   Bart:  What?  Aren't we going to see any washed-up major-leaguers?
   Homer: Sure!  We get a nice mix here.

 ... and Lisa is the one one who manages to stay awake for all of
 it.  The game between the Springfield Isotopes and the pesky Shelbyville
 Shelby-Villians begins, the 'Topes hoping to snap a record 26-game
 losing streak.  Burns is shown to his seat...
   
   Ah, sitting with the employees.  I guess this proves I'm their friend.

   -- Monty Burns joins his employees at the ball game, ``Dancin' Homer''

 Homer bemoans his fate.  Burns orders a tub of beer for himself and
 Homer.
   
   Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
   -- Homer suspects a trap when Burns buys him a beer at the ball game,
      ``Dancin' Homer''
   
 The cost of two 72-ounce tubs is $2.50.  The game continues,
 and Homer and Burns join in taunting the players, and doing `the wave'
 (which looks pretty stupid with only two people).  It's now the bottom
 of the ninth.  One out, the bases are loaded, and the 'Topes are down
 by three.  The batter strikes out (``of course'').
   
   Big Bill McCloskey coming up.  As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the
   post-game show.

 To the music of `Baby Elephant Walk', Homer dances on the dugout and
 fires up the crowd, to the embarrassment of his family.  (Lisa covers
 Maggie's eyes, as well as her own.)
   
   And I got up in front of them.  I felt an intoxication that had nothing to
   do with alcohol.  It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle!
   -- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''
   
 And it works.  McCloskey belts a homer out of the park to win the game.
 But Homer's antics earn him a `banned for life' stamp on his index card.
 In the parking lot, a shadowy figure approaches Homer.  It's Antoine
 Tex O'Hara, the owner, who hires Homer as the team's mascot.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 9:22] [pretty long]

 Homer is decked out in his goofy `Dancin' Homer' outfit and drags the
 family away from dinner to go to the game.
   
   Our lives have taken an odd turn.
   -- Lisa comments on Homer's goofy costume as... ``Dancin' Homer''
   
   Homer:     Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids.  Save room for your nachos!

   -- Marge reacts disapprovingly to Homer's likeness on a T-shirt,

 Homer tries to cast a spell on an opposing player, and gets threatened.
 He asks the organist to play `Baby Elephant Walk' with a reggae beat.
 And two long-haired Caribbean types express their approval.  It's the
 bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and there are two outs...
   
   S! P! R! I! N! G! F! E! E! L! D!!  Springfield!!!!!
   -- Homer spells out the town name while dressed as... ``Dancin' Homer''
   
 But it doesn't help; the 'Topes lose.  Homer is called to Tex's office
 and is informed that he's going to be promoted to the big leagues, to
 fill in for the Capital City Goofball a couple innings a night.
   
   Tex:   Why don't you talk it over with your family?
   Homer: Because they might say no.
   -- Homer learns he's being promoted to work for the Capital City team,

 Bart fears losing his friends, but Homer says he'll make new ones.
   
   We're simple people with simple values.  Capital City is too big and
   too complex.  Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
   -- Lisa lists some reasons not to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''
   
 But Marge tells Homer that this may be his calling in life and he should
 go for it.  The kids are won over.
   
   Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger!
   -- Lisa (quoting Nietzsche) agrees to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''

 then check into the Come Back motel for the night.  Homer practices his
 spelling, but Marge tells him to come to bed.  ``We would talk about it

 At the stadium, Homer goes in the ``Players-Mascots Entrance'', while
 Marge and the kids get their tickets for the players' wives section.

 Meanwhile, Homer complains that he doesn't understand <anything>.
 ``When they look up `stupid' in the dictionary, there'll be a picture
 of me.''  He then dreams of exactly that.  At home...
   
   Marge: [praying]  Dear Lord.  If you spare this town from becoming
          a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian.

   Homer:   Okay okay, think back to your training...

   Trainer: Now, Homer, this may very well save your life one day.
            This... Homer?
   Homer:   [playing with a Rubik's cube]  Yeah?
   Trainer: Please pay attention.  This button here controls the emergency
            override circuit.  In the event of a meltdown, push this button

 pushes the button...

   Burns:  [voice only]
           Yes, we've isolated the problem.  Wouldn't you know, false alarm.
   Marge:  Phew!
   Burns:  It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system.
   Kent:   Very good.  Well, sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well-taken.
           This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant
           in the future.
   Burns:  [in his office, still wearing his radiation suit]
           Excellent.  Well, ta!
   -- Hardly a post-apocalyptic war zone, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Burns asks Smithers to bring him a wine spritzer, and notes that he's
 going to award Homer the Employee of the Month award.  Smithers drops
 the bottle.

 Meanwhile, at lunch, Bart pulls the ol' loose-top-on-the-salt-shaker
 trick on Milhouse, to get back at him for not inviting him to his
 birthday party.
   
   Milhouse: Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend any more.
             That's why you couldn't come to the party.
   Bart:     What's she got against me?
   Milhouse: She says you're a bad influence.
   Bart:     [slams his hand on the table]  Bad influence, my ass!
             How many times have I told you?  Never listen to your mother!
   -- What he said, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Mrs. Van Houten threatened to cut off Milhouse's allowance, and
 Bart offers to pay him double it.  But Milhouse doesn't accept.

 Meanwhile, Smithers tries to convince Burns that he deserves the EotM
 award, but Burns' mind is made up.  In the cafeteria...
   
   Karl:  Hey, way to save our lives!
   Len:   Yeah, we owe you one!
   Homer: Yeah, you know, boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman.
          You just have to read the manual and press the right buttons.
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 Burns arrives and simply says to Homer, ``Come with me.''

 As the audience chants, ``Homer!  Homer!'', he is given the EotM award,
 receiving a ham, a plaque, and discount coupon book from a voluptuous
 woman, a thumbs-up from Burns, and his picture (the old one, back when
 Homer had some hair) added to the `Wall of Fame', which we see consists
 otherwise entirely of photos of Smithers.  And...
   
   Burns: Oh, and what's this?  A congratulatory phone call from Earvin
          `Magic' Johnson?
   Homer: [gasps]  Magic Johnson!?  [picks up the phone]  Yello?
   Magic: [calling from the arena]  Is this really Homer Simpson?
   Homer: Yeah.
   Magic: Wow.  Homer, I just used our last time-out to call and congratulate
          you on averting that nuclear holocaust.
   -- On his way to Disneyland, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Homer asks, ``What if people think a guy's a hero, but he was really
 just lucky.''  Magic replies, ``Don't worry.  Sooner or later, people
 like that are exposed as the frauds they are.''  Homer is glum.

 The kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, but only Lisa laughs.
   
   Lisa: [laughing at an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon]
         Bart, you're not laughing.  Too subtle?
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 Homer arrives and fails to hide the ham and plaque from Marge.
   
   Marge: [reading the plaque]  For heroic competence, for narrowly
          averting a meltdown, and proving without question that
          nuclear power is completely safe.  Employee of the Month!
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 Homer envisions himself listed in the dictionary under, `Fraud'.
 At the dinner table...

   -- No argument from Bart, ``Homer Defined''
   
   Marge: How are you enjoying your ham, Homey?
   Homer: Tastes so bitter, it's like ashes in my mouth...
   Marge: Hm.  It's actually more of a honey glaze.
   Lisa:  Maybe you ate a clove.
   -- Marge and Lisa uncharacteristically miss a metaphor, ``Homer Defined''
   
   Homer: [angrily] What's <your> problem, boy?

   Homer: That four-eyes with a big nose?  You don't need friends like that.
   Lisa:  How Zen...
   -- Dinner conversation, ``Homer Defined''
   
 That evening, Homer watches bowling on TV, munching on salty snacks,
 as Lisa lies on her stomach on the floor and gazes admiringly...
   
   Homer: What is it?  What are you doing?
   Lisa:  Looking at you with quiet awe.
   Homer: Well, as long as it's quiet.
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 In his room, Bart looks through a photo album with pictures of Milhouse,
 and his walkie-talkie crackles.  ``Milhouse to Bart.  Milhouse
 to Bart.  Please don't hate me.  Please?''  Bart tosses it in the trash.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:53]

 Homer is rewarded with a covered parking spot right next to the boss,
 but when he opens his car door, he scratches Burns' paint job.
 (``D'ah, he'll never know who did it.'')  Meanwhile, Smithers now must
 park in the main lot, and finds a spot a half mile from the plant.
   
   Burns:  Ah, Simpson, here's someone I want you to meet.
           Aristotle Amodopoulos, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power
           Facility.  It seems Ari's been having terrible worker
           problems at Shelbyville.
   Ari:    They've lost their zest for work.  You must help them find their
           ine-haratu-nadzu-leri [or whatever].
   Homer:  Their ine-aratu-zoola-what?
   Ari:    Yes!
   -- Just checking, ``Homer Defined''
   
   We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of

   -- Burns seems to have missed the point, ``Homer Defined'
   
 Homer says he can't, but Burns says it's one of the responsibilities
 of being Employee of the Month.  Smithers finally arrives, breathless,
 and complains about the parking.  Burns and Ari gasp, and Burns sends
 Smithers away.  (``That one's always been a problem.'')

 At home, Bart plays Monopoly with Maggie.  He lands on Community Chest
 and looks through the deck to find a card he likes.
   
   Maggie: [playing Monopoly with Bart]
           [removes her pacifier, coughs up a hotel]

   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
   Marge: Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
   Bart:  I don't want to play with Milhouse.
   Marge: You mean you still haven't made up with him?
   Bart:  It's his mom.  She says I'm a bad influence.
          [takes Maggie's hand]  Come on, Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that
          hornet's nest.
   Marge: Mmm...
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 Marge pays a visit to Mrs. Van Houten.
   
   Marge: Mrs. Van Houten?  I'm Bart's mother.  We met in the emergency room
          when the boys drank paint?
   Mrs.V: I remember.
   -- ``Homer Defined''
   
 Mrs.V invites Marge in for tea.
   
   Marge: I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside.
          He's got a spark.  It's not a bad thing.  ... Of course, it makes
          him <do> bad things...
   Mrs.V: Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf `sucks'.
          He must've gotten that from your little boy, because they
          certainly <don't> say that on TV.
   -- Of course, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Marge pleads Mrs.V to let them be friends.  Mrs.V looks outside to see
 Milhouse sitting by himself on a teeter-totter.  She agrees to think about
 it.

 At Moe's Tavern, Lisa is tagging along with Homer, pencil and pad at the
 ready...
   
   Barney: So next time somebody tells you carney folk are good, honest people,
           you can spit in their faces for me!
   Lisa:   I will, Mr. Gumbel, but if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad
           for the school paper.  I thought it would be neat to follow him around
           for a day to see what makes him tick.

   Lisa:  He's just a little nervous.  He has to give a speech tomorrow on
          how to keep cool in a crisis.
   Homer: [shaking Lisa in a panic]  What am I going to do!?
          What am I going to do!?
   -- You could see that gag coming, couldn't you?  ``Homer Defined''
   
   Barney: I had to give a speech once.  I was pretty nervous, so I used a
           little trick.  I picture everyone in their underwear.
           The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
   Homer:  Did it work?
   Barney: I'm a free man, ain't I?
   -- A mixed blessing, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Meanwhile, Bart is playing chess with Maggie, who is sucking on the white
 king.  The walkie-talkie crackles to life...
   
   Milhouse: [on the walkie talkie]  Milhouse to Bart.  Do you want to come
             over and play?
   Bart:     Really?  We can be friends again?  Did your mom die?
   Milhouse: Um, I don't think so.
   Bart:     Well, who cares.
   -- Would you like to check?  ``Homer Defined''
   
 Bart announces to Marge that he's friends with Milhouse again, and Marge
 is pleased.  He thanks her for sticking up for him.  How did he know?
 ``Who else would?''  After a brief tender moment, Marge says, ``Be good,''
 and leaves.  Bart says, ``I will,'' and pulls out from under his bed
 a ``Dead Eye BB Gun''.

 At the Shelbyville plant, Homer is introduced to a large audience.
   
   As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of
   [suddenly turns nasty] loathing and revulsion!  You are not workers!  You
   are a pack of mangy, cud-chewing, ugly goats!
   -- Aristotle Amodopoulos gives his employees a pep talk, ``Homer Defined''
   
 Although
 at first nervous, he remembers Barney's suggestion.  (Barney's ghostly
 elocution here is priceless.)  He puts it into action, and it works.  That
 is, until he looks down at himself and sees that he's also in his underwear.
 He hides behind the podium and reads his speech hesitantly.
   
   Homer: [nervously reading a speech]  Grace under pressure is no...
   Voice: [sirens wail]  Three minutes to meltdown.

 Marge leaves to see Dr. Hibbert.

   Lisa:  Is anything wrong?
   Homer: No, everything's fine.  Your mother uh just... broke her leg.
   Lisa:  What!?

   Lisa:  Is Mom going to have another baby, Dad?
   Homer: [fierce internal struggle manifests itself in wiggling fingers]

   Homer: Yeah, but I have to hear about it.
   -- The duties of fatherhood, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Bart asks what it was like when Marge was pregnant with him, and Homer
 decides to tell them a story.
   
   It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80's.
   Those were idealistic days...  The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of
   Supertramp, it was an exciting time to be young...
   -- Homer tells a story, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer had been dating Marge for several years and working at the miniature
 golf course.  Homer's job is to sit inside the windmill and crank the
 blades.  His boss stops by to tell him to slow it down; the golfers are
 complaining.  Homer slackens the pace.
   
   Boss:  Keep this up, and someday <you> will be the guy who hands out
          the putters!
   Homer: Yes, sir!
   -- A young Homer works at the Merrie Olde Fun Centre, ``I Married Marge''
   
 ``I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend, <and> a job with a
 future,'' notes Homer.  He looks around to find that the kids have vanished.
 Bart and Lisa are playing croquet in the yard.  They thought the story
 was over.
   
   Lisa:  It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad.
          We watch an appalling amount of TV.
   Homer: Don't you ever, EVER talk that way about television.
   -- ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer spots Maggie scurrying away and turns her into a captive audience.
 (We get a wild zoom of Maggie as she swings onto Homer's lap.)

 After Mrs. Bouvier takes a family picture, we hear a car horn outside.
 Marge leaves to go out with Homer, but not before her sisters express
 their scorn for ``that ugly meatball.''
   
   Patty:  If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy, we could get a cat!
   Granma: It would leave less hair on the couch.

 what his plans for the future are.
   
   Marge: I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
   Homer: But it gives me time to think.
   Marge: Oh.  What do you think about?
   Homer: Oh, girls.  I mean, boys.  I, I mean, you.

 In Homer's car (complete with `DISCO SUCKS' bumper sticker), they sing
 `You Light Up My Life' along with the radio, though Homer has trouble
 with the words.
   
   Marge: [listening to `You Light Up My Life' on the radio]  Our song.
   Homer: I bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
   Marge: Well, actually, she was singing about God.
   Homer: Oh, well, He's always happy.  No, wait, He's always mad...
   -- Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?  ``I Married Marge''
   
 Marge and Homer are inside a miniature castle at the golf course.

   Marge: You don't have to do that.
   Homer: Phew.  Good.

   Marge: Maybe it's the champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy.
   Homer: Really?  It <must> be the champale talking.
   -- ``I Married Marge''
   
 They make out.  Marge asks, ``What if we get caught?''  Homer explains,
 ``Don't worry, this castle is impregnable.''  At that moment, a golfer
 putts the ball into a ``Free Game'' hole, and lights flash and bells
 ring.

 Homer watches `Charlie's Angels' with Barney (``Pass the cookie dough.'')
 and celebrates when they're sent on a mission to Hawaii.  He gets a
 phone call from Marge (working as a roller-skated carhop at Bergers
 Burgers) asking to be taken to the doctor.

 Dr. Hibbert breaks the news.
   
   Dr.H:  Well, uh, Miss Bouvier,

 ``Well, I haven't said `no' to you lately, have I?'' replies Marge.
 [Obviously not.]  Homer tries to find the index card on which he

 ``Marge, from the first moment I saw you, I never wanted to be with
 anyone else.  I don't have much to offer you except all my love.

   Homer: `Mucus'.
   Marge: What about Bart?
   Homer: Let's see...  Bart, Cart, Dart, Ee-art...  Nope, can't see any problem
          with that!
   -- Stopped in the nick of time, ``I Married Marge''
   
   Homer: [spots a nice ring]  Wow.  I'll take <that> ring.
   Clerk: Yes, sir, and how will you be paying for it?
   Homer: I don't know.
   -- Good things come to those who wait, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer and Marge drive to `Shotgun Pete's' just past the state line.
   
   Basic ceremony's twenty bucks.  Here's your license.
   Be sure to get this punched every time.  The tenth wedding is on the house.
   -- Clerk at `Shotgun Pete's' quickie marriage emporium, ``I Married Marge''
   
 The minister cries, ``Next!'', and Homer and Marge march down the aisle,
 as Doris plays `Here Comes the Bride' on a synthesizer (with synthetic
 rhythm section).
   
   Minister: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and
             this casino to join... [points at Homer]
   Homer:    Homer.
   Minister: ... and ... [points at Marge]
   Marge:    Marge.
   Minister: ... in holy matrimony.  Beautiful.
             [three minutes later]
             Do you, Marjorie Bouvier take Homer J. Simpson to be your
             lawful wedded husband?
   Marge:    I do.
   Minister: Homer, same question, names reversed.
   Homer:    I do.
   Minister: Then, by the power vested in my by the state gaming commission,
             I pronounce you man and wife.  Here's ten dollars worth of chips.
             You may kiss the bride.
   -- How ``I Married Marge''
   
 As the minister yells, ``Next!'', the photo is taken.

 Back at the Bouvier residence, Patty tells the `lovebirds' to keep it down.
 (Not that they were making much noise in the first place.)

 Marge tallies the bills and comes to an unpleasant conclusion.  Meanwhile,
 Homer shows Marge a `baby monitor' walkie-talkie.  Marge is concerned that
 they can't afford all the baby stuff.
   
   Homer: Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant?
          I hear they pay pretty well.
   Marge: I don't know.  I heard radiation can make you sterile.
   Homer: Pfft.  <Now> you tell me.
   -- ``I Married Marge''
   
 At the plant, there are only two positions available, and three applicants,
 Homer and two other men.  Smithers recognizes the other two as frat
 brothers at Alpha Tau.  They do the frat handshake, then sing a college
 song.  Homer tries to join their singing, but fails miserably.

 Meanwhile, Dr. Hibbert does a sonogram of the unborn Bart, who turns
 his back.  ``Hm, if I didn't know better, I'd swear he was trying to
 moon us.''

 Back at the job interview...
   
   Smithers: What would each of you say is your worst quality?
   Man 1:    Well, I <am> a workaholic.
   Man 2:    I push myself too hard.
   Homer:    Well, it takes me a long time to learn anything,
             I'm kind of a goof-off...
   Smithers: Okay, that'll do.
   Homer:    ... a little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace...
   Smithers: That's enough!
   -- Job interview, ``I Married Marge''
   
   Smithers: There's a problem with the reactor.  What do you do?
   Homer:    There's a problem with the reactor!?  We're all going to die!
             Aaaaaaaugh! [runs out in panic]
   -- Homer's job interview, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Marge goes through the bills, and Homer says he didn't get the job.
 (``They wanted someone good.'')  Marge invites Homer to feel the
 baby kicking.
   
   Homer: [to his unborn son]  Kid, I won't let you down.
          I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first
          thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.
   Patty: Yeah, a doctor!
   -- ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer tries various jobs, but screws up all of them.  First, he
 works at Ye Olde Candlemaker Shoppe in Olde Springfield Towne.  Then
 selling knives door-to-door for Slash-Co Knives.
   
   Homer: Good evening, Madam.  You have been selected by the good people of
          Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife edge.
          Here, shake hands with the Slash-Co!  [hands her the knife]
   Woman: [grabs the wrong end]  Aaaaaagh!
   Homer: [to himself]  Handle first, handle first...
   -- Homer's job experience, ``I Married Marge''
   
 He then works at the Pitiless Pup Attack Dog School, but not for long.
 Next, he attends a `Million$ for Nothing' seminar.
   
   First, let me assure you that this is not one of those shady pyramid
   schemes you've been hearing about.  No sir.  Our model is the trapezoid!
   -- Shady seminar speaker at `Million$ for Nothing', ``I Married Marge''
   
 The speaker hears a siren outside and leaps out the window (through
 the glass) in panic.
   
   Fourth notice.  Ninety days overdue.  We break thumbs.
   -- Marge reads the mail from bill collectors, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Men from Repo Depot come and take all the baby things, as well as
 Marge's ring.
   
   Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
   -- Man from the Repo Depot, ``I Married Marge''
   
 That evening, in the middle of the night, Homer goes to a desk and writes
 Marge a letter.  ``By the time you read this, I will be gone.''  He
 can't afford the things she deserves, and besides, her family doesn't
 like him.  (``Shut up with that pen scratching down there!'' yells Patty
 from upstairs.)  He promises to send her every cent he earns to support
 the child.  He leaves the note on Marge's desk and kisses her good-bye.
 Outside, he puts a `For Sale' sign on his car and moves the `DISCO
 SUCKS' bumper sticker from the car bumper to his suitcase before trudging
 off into the darkness...
   
   Lisa: [crying] That is so sad.
   Homer: Oh, come on, honey.  You know how it turns out.
          After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the
          responsible head of a household.
   Bart:  [poking his head into the room]
          Hey, Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
   Homer: Okay.
   -- Edible complex, ``I Married Marge''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:33]

 Marge finds Homer's note and cries.  Her sisters try to console her.
 (``I thought he'd two-time you for a while first.'')  At the Gulp-N-Blow,
 Patty finds hair in her taco, then spots Homer working behind the
 counter.  The sisters decide not to tell Marge.

 Marge is knitting at home, when she gets a letter from Homer.
 It contains $20 bills, and the simple note, ``Dear Marge, XXX.  Homer.''
 (Which Homer VO's literally.)

 Homer watches the SNPP employees arrive for work and gasps at the
 donut truck that goes in.

 A very pregnant Marge stands in the doorway, waiting for Homer to return.
 Patty can hold her tongue no longer.
   
   Marge, I've got two-and-a-half words for you.  Gulp.  'N'.  Blow.
   -- Patty tells Marge where she can find Homer, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Marge pulls up to the drive-through microphone.
   
   Homer: Yeah, whaddya want.
   Marge: My husband by my side.
   Homer: You want fries with that?
   -- Homer works at the Gulp-N-Blow, ``I Married Marge''
   
 The happy couple are reunited.  (``Holy cow, you're as big as a house!'')
 Marge asks Homer to come home.
   
   Look at me.  I'm a trainee.
   They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce.
   -- Homer works at the Gulp-N-Blow, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer says he can't even afford a decent wedding ring, but Marge says that
 any ring is fine.  So Homer slips an onion ring on her finger.  Marge is
 touched, but adds, ``Would you mind if I took it off now?  The oil is
 burning my finger.''  Homer takes it off, and eats it.  Marge kisses Homer,
 adding, ``Come home soon,'' before driving off.  Homer tears off his
 trainee uniform and stuffs it in a `Thank you' trash bin.  He rushes
 to SNPP, going right past a security kiosk.  (The guard pays absolutely
 no notice.)
   
   That's it... That's it... Come closer... [gobbles a power pellet]
   Muhahaha!  Ironic isn't it.  The hunter has become the hunted!  Hahahaha!!
   -- Monty Burns plays Ms. Pac-Man, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer bursts into Burns' office.
   
   Listen to me, Mister Big-Shot.  If you're looking for the kind of employee
   that takes abuse, and never sticks up for himself, I'M YOUR MAN!  You can
   treat me like dirt, and I'll <still> kiss your butt and call it ice cream!
   And if you don't like it, I can change!!
   -- Homer demands a job from Monty Burns, ``I Married Marge''
   
   I like your attitude.  Feisty, yet spineless.
   -- Monty Burns hires Homer, ``I Married Marge''
   
   Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet
   on his way out.
   -- Smithers voices his objections to the hiring of Homer Simpson,

 Burns responds, ``I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes

   -- The beginning of a tradition, ``I Married Marge''
   
 Homer returns home to Marge, to learn that she's at the hospital.
 Mrs. Bouvier grudgingly gives him a ride.

 Homer arrives and tells off Patty when she bad-mouths him.
   
   Homer:       Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!
   Dr. Hibbert: Good God!
   -- A professional opinion, ``I Married Marge''
   
   Homer: And tomorrow, I'm going to buy your ring back, then I'm going

 Dr. Hibbert delivers a little Bart.

   Homer: Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine
          by me.
   -- The birth of Bart, ``I Married Marge''
   
 As Homer calls him ``Daddy's little angel'', Bart takes a lighter and
 sets Homer's necktie aflame.  ``Why you little!''

 Bart and Lisa are playing Chinese checkers, and Homer invites them to sit
 on his lap.
   
   Homer: You know, son, the day you were born, I received the greatest gift
          a man could have.  As the years went by, your mother and I were
          blessed twice more.  And not a day goes by that we don't thank God
          for all three of you.
   Marge: [comes home]  Homer, I'm not pregnant!

   Marge: Yes!  [exchanges a high five with Homer]
   -- ``I Married Marge''

-- Episode: Homer Alone
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
 Marge tells them enough is enough.  She pokes out the pimentos in Lisa's
 lunch meat.  Bart's hat is where he left it, behind the toilet.  Marge
 will sew Homer's pants, but she's out of baloney.

 Marge is loaded down with bags, Maggie, and the cat (in a carrier), as she
 goes over her list of errands one last time.  Homer asks Marge to take
 his bowling ball to Nick's; there's a bottle cap stuck in the thumb hole.
 Marge says, ``Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?''  Homer
 whines, ``Ohhhhh!  Alley balls!''  Marge gives in.  ``Just put it in my
 left hand.''  He does.  This throws Marge's balance out of kilter.

 Marge spots the school bus outside and tells the kids to hurry up.
 ``No way.''  ``Never happen.''  The bus speeds off.  Says Bart, ``Well
 I'll be damned.''

 With Maggie in the passenger seat (eating the shoulder belt), Marge
 drives the kids to school.
   
   Lisa: Mom, Bart's making faces at me.
   Bart: It's a nervous twitch, and I'm a little sensitive about it,
         if you don't mind.
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
 Bart continues to make faces, prompting Lisa to yell, ``Bart, quit
 it!  Quit it!  Hey, quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Quit it!  Mom!!!!!!''

 The car skids to a halt in front of school.  Marge yells, ``<Get!>
 <Out!>''  Bart and Lisa do, and the car speeds off.

 Grocery shopping.  Marge fetches fruit leather, cheap imitation orange
 drink, Krusty-brand duck sausage pizza...  When Marge leaves the cart alone,
 Maggie throws things out of the cart.  Including a glass jar.  (*smash*)

 Marge goes to Nick's Bowling Shop, to find that she got the wrong Nick's.
 So she goes to the Nick's on the other side of town.  But that's not the
 right one either.

 Driving home, Marge turns on the radio and hears jackhammering.  It's a
 headache commercial.  Next station.  ``It's time for another Bill-and-Marty
 Classic Crank Call.''  They call a man and tell him his wife is dead.
 Then laugh uproariously.  Marge growls some more.  As Marge drives, the
 nerve-wracking events of the day swirl around her head.  Meanwhile, Maggie
 tugs on the nipple of her bottle, eventually succeeding in removing the
 top and spilling milk over the entire car (including Homer's dry-cleaned
 bowling uniform).  This proves too much.  Marge yells, ``Nooooooooooooo!!''
 and skids the car to a halt in the middle of the Springfield Memorial Bridge.
 She then calmly puts the car in park and turns off the ignition.  Traffic
 piles up.  A bus driver comes up to the car window and says, ``Okay, lady,
 this better be good.''  Marge roars.  The man backs off.
   
   This is Arnie Pie with Arnie in the Sky.  We've got big problems on the
   Springfield Memorial Bridge, people.  Traffic going waaaay back in both
   directions.  And look out at the corner of 14th and Elm, because I just
   dropped my bagel.

   Eddie:  She's locked in the car and refuses to move.
   Wiggum: Did you flash your lights?
   Eddie:  Yes.
   Wiggum: [thinks]  Well, <I'm> fresh out of ideas.
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
 Otto takes the opportunity to sunbathe atop the bus.  A mobster yells,
 ``Come on!  I got a body in the trunk!''  Krusty scolds Mr. Teeny for
 screwing around with the car radio.

 Arnie is joined by Kent Brockman.  Kent is lowered from the helicopter
 (wearing a helmet-mounted camera) for an exclusive interview.  But he
 is given too much slack and falls past the bridge.  As they try to
 pull him back up, he bounces against the brick-faced bridge.  (``Ow!'')

 Homer watches the report on television and jokes with his coworkers.
 Until he sees who the unappreciated housewife in question is.  (``D'oh!'')

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:17]

 (Reeboks are really cool.  Drive a Pontiac.  Wash your hair with Permasoft.

 Homer pushes to the front of the crowd, and Chief Wiggum gives him
 a megaphone.
   
   Wiggum: Try to talk her out of there.
           [hands Homer a megaphone]
           But don't put your lips on it or anything.
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
   Homer: [through a megaphone] Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?
   Marge: Homer, is that you?
   Homer: [aside] What should I say?
   Wiggum: Well, how about, ``Yes, it's me.''
   Homer: [through a megaphone] Yes, it's me.
   -- I own a mansion and a yacht, ``Homer Alone''
   
 Homer eventually talks Marge out of the car, and the two embrace.
 ``Cuff her, boys!'' yells Chief Wiggum.

 A mug shot of Marge is taken.  And of her hair.

 In a smoke-filled room, Mayor Quimby tells Chief Wiggum to let Marge
 go.  ``If Marge Simpson goes to jail, I can kiss the chick vote good-bye!''
 Threats are exchanged.
   
   I hereby declare today to be Marge Simpson Day in the city of Springfield!
   -- Mayor Quimby goes after the chick vote, ``Homer Alone''
   
 Apparently, Quimby won the war of nerves.

 Homer goes to sleep.  ``All's well that ends well.''  Marge is still
 upset.  She watches television and catches an advertisement for ``Rancho
 Relaxo'', Springfield's only two-star health spa.
   
   Swim, play tennis, or just sit and stare at the walls.
   -- Advertisement for Rancho Relaxo, ``Homer Alone''
   
 She shuts off the television and wakes Homer.  She says she needs a
 vacation.  Homer reminds her that the family just took a vacation.
   
   Marge: I need to unwind.
   Homer: I knw you do, Marge, but come on, you know what our vacations are
          like.  Those three monsters in the back seat.  ``Are we there yet?
          Are we there yet?''  And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach
          either.  ``Marge, can I have another sandwich?  Marge, can I have
          another sandwich?''
   -- In the comfort of your own home, ``Homer Alone''
   
 Marge explains that she meant by herself.  Homer fears a divorce, but
 Marge reassures him.

 Bart and Lisa are locked inside the station wagon, their noses pressed
 against the glass.  Marge thanks her sisters for taking care of the
 kids while she's gone.  ``We've got six months of maternity leave we're
 never going to use anyway.''  Homer comes out with Maggie, but once the
 baby spots her aunts, she grabs the door frame and doesn't let go.
 (``Wish <I'd> thought of that,'' notes Lisa.)  Homer tries to yank Maggie
 loose, with no success.  Marge suggests that since Maggie doesn't want to
 go, she should just stay home with Homer.  The twins express their
 reservations.
   
   For your information, I can take care of my...
   [Maggie loses her grip and falls]  Auugh!
   [picks up Maggie]  See?  Got her on the first bounce.

 Homer (and Maggie) bid Marge farewell at the train station.

   set of songs about clouds...
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
 Back at home, Homer hears a clattering.  It's Maggie, rattling her cup
 along the bars of her crib.  Maggie points at a picture of Marge.  Homer
 explains, ``Sorry, honey.  Mommy went crazy.''

 Bart and Lisa stare sickly at their lunch.
   
   Selma: Kids, you haven't touched your tongue sandwiches.
          You need something to drink?
   Patty: We've got clamato, Mr. Pibb and soy milk.

   -- Staying with Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma, ``Homer Alone''
   
 Selma tells Lisa she'll be sleeping with her; Bart will sleep with Patty.

 At Rancho Relaxo, Marge turns on the television set in her room.  It's
 a prepared videotape, hosted by none other than...
   
   I'm Troy McClure.  You might remember me from such movies as ``Today

 The shameless promotion continues.  Troy pays a visit to the kitchen.
 Troy gets a massage.  Marge follows the instructions and dials for service.

 Back at home, Homer has trouble feeding Maggie.
   
   Homer:  Come on, Maggie.  Nummy-nummy-num!
   Maggie: [refuses to eat her baby food]
   Homer:  Aaaaahhh...  [eats some to demonstrate]

           Mmm... strained peas.

 Homer reclines on the couch, then gets up, revealing Maggie underneath him.

 Homer enlists the aid of a staple gun to change Maggie's diaper.

 Homer entertains Maggie with a puppet show, but SLH attacks the puppets
 (and Homer as well).  Maggie applauds.

 Back at Rancho Relaxo, Marge gets a massage.
   
   Marge, it's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of that Mexican med school.

 Barney pays Homer a visit, at Homer's request.  Barney spots the baby.
 ``Wow, if it isn't little Bart!''
   
   [picks up Maggie] Whoa!  Someone smells stinky!
   [sniffs himself]  Oh, it's me.
   -- Barney, bastion of cleanliness, ``Homer Alone''
   
 At bedtime, Bart rummages through Patty and Selma's closet.  ``I've said
 it before, and I'll say it again.''  Bart produces a bra.  ``Ay, Carumba!''
 He then shoots Lisa with what is later identified as a blackhead gun.
 (``Ewwww!'')   The twins return from their television-watching.
 ``Best MacGyver ever.''  ``Richard Dean Anderson will be in my dreams
 tonight.''  They turn in, and Selma proceeds to snore sickly.  Bart and
 Lisa remain wide awake.  And shudder.

 Marge curls up in bed, then realizes she has the entire bed to herself
 and stretches out.

 Homer tries to sing Maggie to sleep.
   
   [sung to Brahms' Lullaby]
   Go to sleep...
   And good night...
   La-la la la la la la...
   Dee-dee-dee...
   Dee-dee-dee...
   May your Christmas Days be bright!
   -- Homer sings Maggie to sleep, ``Homer Alone''
   
 ``Good night, my little pork chop.''  Maggie remains wide awake throughout.
 After Homer leaves, Maggie looks forlornly at a photo of Marge, climbs out
 of her crib, across the kitchen floor (and Barney).  Maggie crawls out the
 doggie door and spots something tall... and blue!   But it's a bush.
 Maggie continues onward down the street into the darkness...

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:58]

 (Reeboks are really, really cool.  So is a Game Boy.  And brush your teeth
  with Crest.  Watch pro wrestling.  Watch Married ... with Children.  Stay
  tuned for Drexel's Class.  Back to the show.)

 Homer comes into Maggie's room for her 9am feeding.  (It's 11:45.)
 But she's gone!  Home searches everywhere.  Barney announces that
 he's going to make a breakfast omelet.  But Homer wants him to help
 look for the baby.

 Barney thinks he's found Maggie, underneath the front stoop.  He pulls
 with all his might.  ``Barney, you're going to pull her arm off!''
 ``The sooner I get her out, the sooner we can have omelets!''  Barney
 finally wrests it free.  A water hose (spraying).

 Maggie wanders through the Springfield Mall.  She spots a tall, blue
 hairdo in the beauty salon...
   
   Hairdresser:  So, what's the verdict?
   Woman:        [realizes she's been given a Marge Simpson hairdo]
                 Oh, dear God!  I can't even put a bag over my head!
   Hairdresser:  Yes you can.
   -- ``Homer Alone''
   
 Disappointed, Maggie continues...

 Homer calls the Department of Missing Babies.  The hold music is
 ``Baby Come Back''.  Homer starts crying.

 At Rancho Relaxo, Marge goes down a checklist.  ``Bungee jumping,
 kayaking, calligraphy, cigar-making, hula dancing.  Hm, I guess
 I've done everything.''  She relaxes in a grass skirt and coconuts.
 The videotaped message continues.  Troy tells Marge that the next
 step is up to her.
   
   As I said to Dolores Montenegro in ``Calling All Quakers''...
   ``Have it <your> way, Baby!''
   -- Troy McClure, ``Homer Alone''
   
 Troy then hang-glides off a cliff.  Marge calls room service and orders
 a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream, and some chocolate-chip cheesecake,
 and a bottle of tequila.  Marge soaks in the tub (watching `Thelma and
 Louise'), takes a bite of her sundae, sinks underwater, and emerges,
 her hair down, completely relaxed.

 Homer pays a visit to Patty and Selma's apartment.  Bart and Lisa instant
 yell, ``Dad!'' and each clutch one of Homer's legs.  He asks the kids
 if they've seen Maggie.  They haven't, and Homer rushes off, leaving Bart
 and Lisa in the hallway.  Selma calls, ``Come on, kids!  It's time to rub
 Aunt Patty's feet!''  Lisa and Bart shudder.

 Maggie spots a shadow of a tall hairdo, but it's just a beefeater, trying
 hawk a lube job shop.

 Homer cries, then brightly answers the phone.  It's Marge, who says she
 feels much better.  Homer asks her how she'd feel if the dog ran away.
 Marge says, ``That's awful!''  Homer has some good news for her; the dog
 didn't run away.  Marge says she's coming home.  ``You can pick me up
 at the train station in an hour.  And bring the kids.  Bye.''

 Chief Wiggum talks through a megaphone.  ``Please!  Don't jump!  I know
 you're going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead
 of you!''  Pan across to show Maggie serenely asleep atop the roof of

 a tall, blue, soft ice cream cone head.

 Homer tries to plan his excuse.
   
   Marge, Maggie was very young.  It's not like we got so attached to her...
   -- Homer practices his excuse for losing Maggie, ``Homer Alone''
   
 He answers the door.  It's Chief Wiggum.
   
   Wiggum: You the man who reported the lost baby?
   Homer:  Yes.
   Wiggum: Can you describe her?
   Homer:  Uh, she's small...  She's a girl...
   Wiggum: Bingo!  [produces Maggie]
   -- ``Homer Alone''
-- Episode: Homer at the bat
 At the plant, Homer digs into the donuts, eating a half dozen in rapid
 succession.
   
   Homer: [scarfing down donuts]
   Lenny: Hey, Homer, slow down.  You're going to choke or something.
   Homer: Don't tell me how to eat donuts!  [starts choking]
   Karl:  [matter-of-factly] Hey, Homer's choking again.
   Lenny: Isn't there a first-aid chart around here somewhere?
   Karl:  Somebody scare him.
   Charlie: That's for the hiccups!
   -- Remain calm, dough-nut panic, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Lenny looks at the company bulletin board, on which is a Heimlich Maneuver
 poster.  ``Hey, look at this!''  But he was referring to the softball team
 sign-up sheet.  Homer finally dislodges the donut and eagerly signs up.
 He invites the others to sign up as well, but they don't share his
 enthusiasm.
   
   Lenny: Homer, last year, we were 2 and 28.
   Homer: Look, I know it wasn't our best season...
   Lenny: Actually, it was.
   -- Room for improvement, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Homer tells them that this year will be different.  He has a secret weapon.
 The other employees muse about what this weapon could possibly be...
 Charlie imagines that Homer has a giant glove.  Karl imagines Homer
 is able to sproing from base to base.  Lenny imagines Homer having a
 death ray, with which he incinerates the opposition.  Everybody signs
 up eagerly.

 In the Simpsons garage...
   
   Homer: Come here, boy, I want to show you something.
   Bart:  What's that, a homemade bat?
   Homer: It's something very special.  A homemade bat.
   -- A Homer-made bat, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Homer explains...
   
   It all started last year during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked
   myself out of the house.  Shelving myself with a large piece of sheet metal,
   I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find!
   -- Homer Simpson, Safety Inspector, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 A bolt of lightning strikes the tree, and a large branch falls to the
 ground, the point at which it had been joined to the tree still glowing.
 ``Something told me this was a very special, very magical piece of wood...
 that I could make a bat out of.''  Putting his homemade football on hold,
 Homer sets to work planing, sawing, nailing (?), and acetylene torching (!)
 the branch.
   
   Homer: [working to build a baseball bat in the garage]
   Marge: Homey, come to bed.
          [scene change:  Marge is in bed, as wood shavings flick onto her
           from Homer's woodwork in bed]
          Homer, go back to the garage.
   -- Yessss, master, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Homer shows Bart the bat.
   
   Bart:  [sees Homer's homemade bat]  Wow!  How many home runs you gonna
          hit with that?
   Homer: Let's see.  We play thirty games.  Ten at-bats a game.  Mmm...
          Three thousand.
   -- Back-of-the-envelope calculations, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 At the softball field, the police force team faces the nuclear power plant
 team.  After some warm-up, the umpire briefs the teams on the ground rules.
   
   Umpire: Okay, let's go over the ground rules.
           You can't leave first until you chug a beer.
           Any man scoring has to chug a beer.
           You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings.
           Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning.
   Chief Wiggum:  [in baseball uniform]  Hey, we know how to play softball.
   -- The canonical softball drinking game, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 The field is set...
   
   Umpire: Play ball!
   Chief Wiggum: [steps to the plate]
   Police radio: Attention all units!  Attention all units!
           Armored car being robbed at 59th and...
   Chief Wiggum: Turn off that damn radio!
   -- Please arrange to have your car robbed only during normal business hours,
      ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Marge and the kids are in the stands watching the game.  Marge has a
 video camcorder (borrowed from Ned, no doubt) and narrates the game.
   
   And the man wants to hit the ball, too.  [crack!]  And he does.
   And there he goes, off in that direction.  And everyone is happy.
   -- Marge Simpson does the play-by-play, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Despite Bart's offer to help, Marge maintains that she can handle the
 play-by-play herself.  The police team hit a homer run and shoot their
 guns in celebration.  (``Hey, stop that!'' scolds Chief Wiggum.)

 The game is in the bottom of the ninth, two out, the police up 5 to 2,
 the bases are loaded, and it's Homer turn at bat.  It's secret weapon
 time, but when his teammates see that it's his magic bat, they take the
 opportunity to make fun of it.  (``And I have an enchanted jockstrap,''
 kids Karl.)

 Homer steps to the plate, and it's a homer for Homer.  (The ball sails
 past the fence to a picnic area, striking a man on his head as he is
 about to eat a sandwich.)  Homer taunts the losing team.  (``Ha ha,
 cops can't win!''  ``Get his licence and registration,'' orders Chief
 Wiggum.)

 At home, Homer reviews the videotape as Bart and Lisa admire.
   
   Lisa:  Wow, Dad!
   Bart:  Homer, can I get you a beer?
   Lisa:  No, <I> want to get him a beer.
   Homer: Kids, kids, kids!  You can <each> get me a beer.
   -- Beer and beer alike, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 But first, Homer re-watches the game-winning hit in super-slow-motion.
 (His ample belly provides considerable jiggle.)

 The nuclear plant team plays against several other opponents, and Homer's
 enchanted bat continues its magic.  The other players on the team
 have their own `magic bats', made from such curious objects as a piano leg
 and a wooden leg.

 At the Millionaire's Club atop the Springfield Trade Center, Smithers
 informs Burns of the team's success; they need only defeat Shelbyville
 next week to capture the pennant.  Burns' lunch companion is Ari
 Amodopoulos, who challenges Burns' confidence in his team.
   
   Ari:   Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
   Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting!
   Ari:   What, a million dollars isn't interesting to you?
   Burns: Oh, did you say a million?  I'm, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
          I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would
          bait each other, and, well, you know how it goes.
          Yes, certainly, a million would be fine.  [handshake]
   -- But gambling is illegal in 48 states... ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 [End of Act One]

 In Burns' office...
   
   Burns:    Smithers, I've been thinking.  Is it wrong to cheat to win
             a million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: Yes, sir.
   Burns:    Let me rephrase that.  Is it wrong if <I> cheat to win a
             million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: No, sir.  Who would you like killed?
   -- Burns remembers to phrase it as an ethical question, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Burns had in mind hiring ringers for the team.  He unveils a
 chart of a baseball diamond, with names like Honus Wagner and
 Mordecai ``Three-Finger'' Brown.  Smithers points out that all of the
 plays have retired, and are long dead.  (``In fact, your right fielder
 has been dead for 130 years.'')  So Burns sends Smithers out to scour
 the American, National, and Negro Leagues to find players.  He has 24 hours.

 At an autograph session...
   
   Smithers: [whispers in Jose Canseco's ear]
   Jose:     I get $50,000 to play one game?
   Smithers: That's right, Mr. Canseco.
   Jose:     Well, it's a pay cut, but what the hey.  It sounds like fun.
   -- For love of money, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Smithers scrambles through the woods and narrowly escapes being shot at.
   
   Smithers: [in the woods, a bullet grazes his shoulder]
   Hunter:   Hey, sorry.  I thought you were a deer.
   Smithers: Heh heh, that's okay.  Happens all the time.
   -- ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 The hunter is none other than Mike Scioscia, who muses that he sometimes
 wishes he were doing something a little more blue-collar, ``with big
 machines and cool dials and stuff.  Like an oil refinery, or hydro-electric
 plant.''

 At Graceland, the tour guide shows Elvis's three television sets.
 There, Smithers approaches Ozzie Smith.

 Smithers rings a doorbell, and the door is answered by Don Mattingly,
 who was doing the dishes.  Mattingly eagerly invites Smithers in.

 Smithers invites Steve Sax, who was performing with the Steve Sax Trio.

 At a company meeting, Burns introduces security guard Roger Clemens,
 janitor Wade Boggs, lunchroom cashier Ken Griffey, Jr., and Steve Sax,
 Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose
 Canseco (for whom he'll make up jobs later).  The employees are
 impressed until they realize that the players are joining the softball
 team.  Lenny complains, ``Mr. Burns, with them on the team, you won't
 need us!''  Burns replies, ``Well, DUH!''

 Burns orders Scioscia to sign up, but Mike is excited about working the
 solid contaminant encapsulator.  ``One more outburst like that and I'll
 send you back to the big leagues.''
   
   Homer:  You're Darryl Strawberry.
   Darryl: Yes?
   Homer:  You play right field.
   Darryl: Yes?
   Homer:  I play right field, too.
   Darryl: So?
   Homer:  Well, are you better than me?
   Darryl: Well, I never met you... but... Yes.
   -- Any questions? ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 At dinner, Homer grouses that the whole team worked hard to reach the
 championship game, only to be replaced.  Meanwhile, Maggie feeds her
 Brussel sprouts to SLH.
   
   Marge: What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better
          than you?
   Homer: Marge, forget it.  He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger
          than me, and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
   Bart:  You make me sick, Homer.  You're the one who told me I could do
          anything if I just put my mind to it!
   Homer: Well, now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's
          a crock!  No matter how good you are at something, there's always
          about a million people better than you.
   Bart:  Gotcha.  Can't win, don't try.
   -- Lesson for the day, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 The team is on the field for practice.  Burns is wearing an old-style
 uniform with ``Zephyrs'' on the front.  He lectures the players that
 they all have to earn their spot on the team.  And rather than beer,
 they are instead to drink a special nerve tonic which promotes health
 (though has also been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases).
 Ken Griffey, Jr. takes a sip and is hooked.  Time for the training to
 begin, and all groan when Smithers brings out the medicine balls.

 In the training room, everybody is working out, except for Homer, who
 is in one of those steam reducing gizmos.

 At the plate, Burns demonstrates how to bunt.  But when the ball hits
 the bat, Burns goes sailing into the backstop.
   
   Smithers: What are you going to do with the million dollars, sir?
   Burns:    Oh, I dunno.  Throw it on the pile, I suppose.
   -- Burns has bet $1 million on the softball team, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 To help seal the victory, Burns hires a hypnotist.
   
   Hynpotist: You are all very good players...
   Team:      [entranced] We are all very good players...
   Hypnotist: You will beat Shelbyville...
   Team:      We will beat Shelbyville...
   Hypnotist: You will give one hundred and ten percent...
   Team:      That's impossible.  No one can give more than one hundred percent.
              By definition that is the most anyone can give...
   -- You own a mansion and a yacht...  ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Back in the field, a fly ball is hit to Homer, but Darryl Strawberry
 leaps upwards out of frame to catch the ball.  When Homer complains,
 Darryl says to Burns, ``Some of these players have a bad attitude, Skip.''

 At the plant...
   
   Mike Scioscia: [pushing a wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
   Karl:  [pulls up beside him with his own wheelbarrow of glowing green goop]
          Hey, Scioscia.  I don't get it.  You're a ringer, but you're here every
          night in the core, busting your butt hauling radioactive waste.
   Mike Scioscia: Well, Karl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing
          big-league ball.  I mean, there, you make any kind of mistake, and
          boom, the press is all over you.  [accidentally spills his goop]
          Uh oh...
   Karl:  Ah, don't worry about it.
   Mike Scioscia: Oh man, is this ever sweet...

 Bart and Ralph are choosing up sides for a pick-up baseball game.  Ken
 Griffey, Jr. stops by, and Ralph chooses him.  Bart, annoyed, chooses
 Milhouse.  Wade Boggs comes past, and Ralph picks him.  Bart reluctantly
 chooses Lewis.  Ralph chooses Jose Canseco.  (``D'oh!'')

 Burns orders Mattingly to get rid of his sideburns.  Curiously, Mattingly
 isn't wearing sideburns at all.

 Homer steps to the plate with WonderBat.  Roger Clemens throws the ball
 so fast, it burns Homer's bat in two.

 It's the day before the game, and Burns gives his team some final advice.
 (Darryl Strawberry chimes in sycophantically.)
   
   Now, before I post the starting line-up, I want to assure those of you
   whose names are not on the list... that I'm very disappointed in you.
   -- Monty Burns, softball team manager, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
   Homer: Please please please, I want to make the team.  [catches Roger Clemens]
          Clemens, did I make the team?
   Roger: You sure did!
   Homer: I did!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  In your face, Strawberry!
   Roger: Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey, Jr.?
   Homer: No.
   Roger: Sorry.  Didn't mean to get your hopes up.
   -- ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 [End of Act Two]

 In his office, Burns gloats that there's no way he could lose his bet.
 ``Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate
 misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow.  But that will never happen.
 Three misfortunes, that's possible.  Seven misfortunates, there's an
 outside chance.  But nine misfortunes?  I'd like to see that!''

 His wish is the writer's command.

 Steve Sax is pulled over by the two cops.  When they see that he's from
 New York City, the haul him into jail, since there's an unsolved murder
 in the Big Apple.

 Mike Scioscia lies in a hospital bed, a nearby Geiger counter clicking away.

   Mike Scioscia: Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate...
   -- ``Homer at the Bat''
   
 Thanks to acute radiation poisoning, he's out of the game.  Ken Griffey,
 Jr. is wheeled in, his head swollen to gargantuan proportions, thanks to
 the nerve tonic.

 Jose Canseco is walking down the street when he passes a burning house.
 The woman outside pleads for him to rescue her baby.  Being the kind,
 generous soul that he is, Jose rushes into the burning house and emerges
 with the child.  She then hears her cat, and Jose rescues it as well.
 She hears her player piano.  Jose pulls up his collar and heads back in
 again.

 milk itself has frozen.

 At home, Homer sends the thermostat up to 100 degrees (Fahrenheit),
 cranks the stereo to full power, and dances around the house wearing
 only his underwear and sunglasses, singing ``Short Shorts.''  He then
 raids the fridge to make one of his patented out-of-this-world space-age

   Kids, let me tell you about another so-called [makes quotation marks with
   fingers] ``wicked'' guy.  He had long hair and some wild ideas.  He didn't
   always do what other people thought was right.  And that man's name was...
   I forget.  But the point is...  I forget that, too.  Marge, you know what
   I'm talking about.  He used to drive that blue car?
   -- Homer's parable of the guy in the blue car, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
   Marge: Homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my God, because
          you just can't win.
   Homer: There you go again, always taking someone else's side.
          Flanders, the water department, God...
   -- They're all against me, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Homer turns down one last opportunity to go to church.  At church, Reverend
 Lovejoy's sermon begins with a pronouncement that the devil lives among them.
 Bart attacks a man with a goatee before Reverend Lovejoy can explain what
 he meant.

 Homer lounges in his underwear reading a Lorne Michaels interview in
 ``Playdude'' magazine.
   
   ``Our unabashed dictionary defines IUD as `love springs internal'.''
   Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh! ... I don't get it.
   -- Homer reads ``Playdude'' magazine, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Krusty comes to the door collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns.
   
   Homer:  Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?
   Krusty: A religious <clown> think, yes.
   -- Krusty collects for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Homer slams the door in his face.

 Reverend Lovejoy recites the commandment ``Keep holy the Sabbath day'',
 as Homer buys a crate of Duff and a box of cigars from the Kwik-E-Mart.
 Homer notes that Apu isn't in church, but Apu corrects him:  He has a
 shrine to Ganeesha in the employee lounge.  Homer walks over to the
 multi-armed elephant, ``Hey, Ganeesha.  Wanna peanut?''
   
   Please do not offer my god a peanut.
   -- Apu, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Homer makes some disparaging remarks regarding Apu's choice of religion.
   
   [angrily] Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and
   [brightly] come again!
   -- Apu, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 ``Pride goeth before Destruction,'' proclaims Reverend Lovejoy.

 Homer lounges on the couch smoking a cigar.
   
   Boy, everyone is stupid except me.
   -- Homer Simpson, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 He falls asleep and the cigar falls out of his mouth onto
 the copy of ``Playdude'', lighting it.  The fire quickly spreads throughout
 the house, aided by the oily rags and blasting caps stored in the basement.
 The house is now engulfed in flame.  ``Marge, turn down the heat. ...  That's
 better.''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:49]

 Santa's Little Helper rushes into the burning living room and tugs at Homer's
 robe.  He finds a Hershey's bar, takes it, and escapes.  The fire singes
 Homer's two hairs, which wakes him up.
   
   Aaaaaugh!  [finds himself in the middle of a fire]  What do I do?  What do
   I do?  [cough cough]  Oh, the song.  The song.
   [sings] When the fire starts to burn,
           There's a lesson you must learn.
           Something something, then you'll see:
           You'll avoid catastrophe!
   [realizes]  D'oh!
   -- Homer's lesson for the day, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Homer collapses from the smoke.

 Through his binoculars, Apu spots the fire.  He puts on his shiny Fire Chief
 hat and leaves little Jamshed to watch the store.  The young boy cocks out
 a shotgun.  ``I have waited for this day.''  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph freeze
 in their tracks.

 The volunteer fire truck races towards the Simpsons house.  But first, it
 must wait at a duck crossing.  Ned discovers the burning house and rushes in
 to carry Homer out.  But his exit is blocked by a fallen burning beam.  So
 he carries Homer to Maggie's room, tosses out a mattress, then shoves Homer
 out the window after a prayer.  Homer lands on the mattress and bounces
 back into the house via the front bay window.  With a sigh, Ned does the
 same.  He finally drags Homer out the now-broken front window as the
 fire truck arrives.
   
   Homer: Flanders, you saved me!  Why?
   Ned:   Heck!  You'd'a done the same for me.
   Homer: [thought balloon:  Ned screams for help, trapped in his house.  Homer
          lounges in his hammock chuckling.]  That's right, old friend.
   -- ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Marge and the kids rush to Homer's side, concerned.
   
   Our magazines and roach traps...  Gone!  All gone!
   -- Homer remains in a state of shock after the house fire,
      ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Krusty saves the cat.  Barney uses the axe to chop the Simpsons mailbox.
 Lisa notes, ``Truly this was an Act of God.''  The fire spreads to Ned's
 house, and Homer notes, ``Hey.  Flanders is a regluar Charlie Church, and
 God didn't save <his> house.''  A tiny cloud forms over the Flanders
 house, the rain dousing the fire, and the damage sealed with a rainbow.

 The insurance representative arrives.
   
   Insurance agent: Any valuables in the house?
   Homer:           Well, the Picasso, my collection of classic cars...
   Insurance agent: Sorry, this policy only covers actualy losses,
                    not made-up stuff.
   Homer:           [miffed] Well that's just great!
   -- ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 A Channel 6 mobile truck has arrived.
   
   Brockman: Fire, Man's Oldest Foe.  Insatiable, remorseless, unquenchable.
   Wiggum:   Hey, it's out!  [cheers]
   Brockman: [brightly] Coming up next:  Which work better?  Spring clothespins
             or the other kind?
   -- ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 In the kitchen, the firefighters enjoy a well-deserved mug of hot cocoa.
 Homer learns his lesson:
   
   The Lord is veangeful.  [falls to his knees]  Oh Spiteful One,
   Show me who to smite, and he shall be smoten!
   -- Homer, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
   Ned:          Homer, God didn't set your house on fire.
   Rev. Lovejoy: No, but He <was> working in the hearts of your friends and
                 neighbors when they came to your aid,
   be they [points to Ned] Christian, [Krusty] Jew, or [Apu] ... miscellaneous.
   Apu:          Hindu!  There <are> 700 million of us.
   Rev. Lovejoy: Aw, that's super.
   -- ``Homer the Heretic''
   
   Homer: I was rude to every one of you, and you saved my life when you could've
          just left me to fry like the proverbial pancake that I am.
   Marge: Aw, Homer, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
   -- ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 Homer promises to be in church next Sunday, front row center.

 And he holds his promise, snoring loudly in the front pew.  Homer enters
 Dream-Land.
   
   Don't worry, Homer.  Nine out of ten religions fail in their first year.
   -- God, ``Homer the Heretic''
   
 In the background Ben Franklin (Yes, Ben Franklin) beats Jimi Hendrix
 at air hockey.
   
   Homer: What's the meaning of life?

   Homer: I can't wait that long!
   God:   You can't wait six months?

 Homer wants to know now, so God decides to tell him.  ``The meaning of life

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:46]

-- Episode: Homer goes to college
Agent 1: [presses the buzzer]
  Burns: [awakening, over the intercom] Mmm...hmm...what?  How dare you
         disturb me during nap time.
Agent 1: We're from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  This is a
         surprise test of worker competence.
  Burns: There must be some mistake.  We, er, we make cookies here: Mr.
         Burns' Olde-Fashioned Good-Time Extra-Chewy --
Agent 2: [to Agent 3] Get the axe.
-- We've done this before, "Homer Goes to College"

Smithers and Burns watch from the window as the inspectors lead some
plant employees into their vehicle.

   Burns: The watchdog of public safety...is there any lower form of
          life?
Smithers: Don't worry sir, I rounded up our less gifted employees and
          led them into the basement.
           [Shot of the basement with Homer and two other guys]
  Bernie: Duh, Homer, why are we down here?
   Homer: Aw, geez.  I told you, Bernie: to guard the bee!
     Man: [whining] But why?
   Homer: Aw, you guys are pathetic.  No wonder Smithers made me head
          bee-guy.
           [Homer kicks the jar accidentally, smashing it, and the bee
          escapes]
  Bernie: Duh, he's gettin' away.
     Man: Oh, we did bad!
-- No recess for you, "Homer Goes to College"

The inspectors want to test Homer's competence next, but Smithers
apologizes for him, saying, "He couldn't _bee_ here."  Burns fobs them
off with some excuse about Homer chairing a conference on nuclear
fission in Geneva.  Unfortunately, Homer jumps up through a manhole
cover just then, exclaiming, "The bee bit my bottom!  Now my bottom's
big!"

The inspectors put Homer in the van.

Agent 2: Homer, this is an exact replica of your work station.
  Homer: [moans]
Agent 2: Now we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
  Homer: What the hell are you talking about?
-- This won't look good on a resume, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer is despondent.

  Homer: What do I do?  What do I do?  In the name of God you've got to
         tell me!  [sobbing]
Agent 2: Relax, it's just a simulator.  Nothing can go wrong.
  Homer: [sotto voce] Just poke blindly at the controls until they let
         you go.
-- It's worked before, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer begins doing just that, but something goes horribly wrong.  "This
can't be happening!" exclaims one of the inspectors, as the van begins
to glow green and sink into the ground.  Panic ensues at the plant.
Burns decides to try to get away in his escape pod.  He activates the
entrance to the pod, jumps in, and slams the door shut.  Smithers
implores, "For the love of God, sir, there are two seats!" but Burns
likes to put his feet up.  The pod takes off, but doesn't even come
close to reaching escape velocity.  Instead, it crashes into the street
and continues bouncing down it in a crumpled ball.

A glowing green Homer rises out of the hole left where the van used to
be, growling and fearsome.  "Must destroy mankind," he intones, but the
alarm on his watch goes off, reminding him that it's lunch time.  He
shakes off his radioactivity and bounds off to eat.

The agents watch the detox team spray the hole in the parking lot with a
foamy sealant.

Agent 2: I'm still not sure how he caused the meltdown.  There wasn't
         any nuclear material in the truck!
  Burns: Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe.
         Now, you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely
         Smithers is standing, or you can trade it all in for what's in
         this box.
-- I can't decide, Monty, "Homer Goes to College"

One inspector wants the box, but the other inspector remembers her
ethics.  She explains that Burns can't make the problem go away just by
throwing money at it, but just then, Mayor Quimby walks by in a fur coat
labeled "$5000" saying that he he's decided there will be no
investigation.  He then leaves.

The inspectors tell Burns that Homer's job requires college training in
nuclear physics.  If he doesn't get Homer up to speed, they tell him,
they'll be forced to take legal action.  "Is that so?" asks Burns.  "I
have the feeling you'll be dropping the charges," he says, emphasizing
"dropping" as he pushes a red button on his desk.  A trap door springs
open, but it's nowhere near where the inspectors are standing.  "The
painters moved your desk," Smithers reminds him.

The doorbell rings at the Simpsons house, and Homer goes to answer it.

 Homer: [answers the door, sees Burns with his lawyers] Aah!
 Burns: Hello, Simpson.  My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and
        thought we'd stop by.
 Marge: [nervously] Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow
        squares?
         [The lawyers discuss it quietly amongst themselves]
Lawyer: Yes, he would.
-- Executive decision, "Homer Goes to College"

At the table, Homer asks Burns to confirm that he must go to college.
Bart scoffs, asking Homer, "College?  Barber or Clown?"

   Burns: Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on
          your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101.
          Oh, and one more thing: [ominously] you must find the jade
          monkey before the next full moon.
Smithers: Actually sir, we found the jade monkey; it was in your glove
          compartment.
   Burns: And the road maps?  And ice scraper?
Smithers: They were in there too, sir.
   Burns: Ex-cellent!  It's all falling into place.
-- Now as long as there are no meddling kids..., "Homer Goes to College"

That night, in bed, Marge expresses her support for the idea of Homer
going to college.  "You could learn so much," she thinks.  "Maybe you're
right," says Homer, "I did always want to go to college, {but fate stood
in the way."  He thinks back to high school, where his guidance
counselor tried to get him to sign an application, assuring him, "You're
a shoe-in," but Homer gets distracted by a dog with a ham outside.
Sighing, the counselor throws Homer's application away.}

{Back in the present, Homer is filling out college applications.  His
garbage bin is full of crumpled paper.}

Homer: [growls in frustration]
 Lisa: Dad, don't let these application essays throw you.  Let's see:
       "List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your
       life."
Homer: Is "TV Guide" a book?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: "Son of Sniglet"?
 Lisa: No.
Homer: Katherine Hepburn's "Me"?
 Lisa: No!
Homer: Oh, I suck.
-- "Reading Digest" counts, though, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer slaves away at the applications.

Homer: [writing] "...It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my
       life forever."
 Bart: You the man, Homer!
Homer: Thanks, boy!
-- What it is, "Homer Goes to College"

For the crowning touch, Homer pastes his photo to the application.  The
one he chooses shows him cramming a birthday cake into his mouth, as
Marge looks on worriedly.

 Bart: I dunno, Dad: don't you have a better picture?
Homer: Relax.  A photo can't make any difference.
        [A man and a woman review applications, and they come across
       Homer's]
  Man: [looking at the photo] He looks crazy.
Woman: Agreed.  Reading his essay would only waste valuable seconds.
-- Next!, "Homer Goes to College"

Bart watches TV at home.

Finally!  The great taste of Worcestershire Sauce in a soft drink.
Ah..."Steakie"!
-- A TV commercial, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer walks in and preempts Bart's program for a show about college that
he really should watch.  The show is called "School of Hard Knockers",
and it stars Corey Masterson.

 Prez: [on TV] Dean Bitterman, I hope nothing unsavory happens during my
       visit.  As you know, I _am_ the President of the United States.
 Dean: Oh, don't worry.  I've expelled those rowdy members of Chugalug
       house.
Homer: [watching] Ohh, I hate that lousy Dean!
Corey: [on TV] Your Bra Bomb better work, Nerdlinger!
 Nerd: Hey!
        [Corey presses the plunger; an explosion occurs in the
       background]
        [Many colors of bras rain down on the Dean and the President]
 Dean: Corey?!  Don't worry, Mr. President, I --

 Prez: Lighten up, Bitterman...that youngster will make a perfect
       addition to my cabinet.  Secretary of Partying Down!
 Dean: [growls; a bra falls on his head]
Homer: [triumphant] Yes!  Take _that_, Bitterman.
-- College is _just_ like that, "Homer Goes to College"

Marge brings in the mail: it has the decision letters from all the
colleges Homer applied to.  Sadly, none of them are letters of
acceptance.

 Bart: Well, Pop, what are you going to do?
Homer: [resolutely] Something I should have done a _long_ time ago.
        [long pause]
Marge: You don't know, do you?
Homer: [meekly] No, ma'am.
-- Homer's empty life, "Homer Goes to College"

Burns thinks he has a solution.  He wants to use his power at
Springfield University, where he holds a chair.  But the meeting is more
difficult than he has foreseen.

  Man: I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but I must object.  This Simpson is not
       qualified!
        [There are nods of agreement]
Burns: I see.  Well, you know, fellows, I look at the admissions board a
       lot like a baseball team.  You all like baseball, don't you?
        [Everyone assents]
       Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork,
       [Smithers hands him a baseball bat] not some hot-dog admissions
       officer playing by his own rules!
        [Burns starts hitting the man in the head with almost no force]
  Man: [noticing] Er, excuse me, what are you doing?
Burns: I'm giving you the [grunt] beating of your life!
  Man: Look, if -- stop that!  -- you wanted him that badly, why didn't
       you just say so?
Burns: [collapses from exertion] Smithers, dismember the corpse and send
       his widow a corsage.
-- "Homer Goes to College"

Homer is elated: Burns' tactic worked!

Homer: Woo-hoo!  I'm a college man!  I won't need my high school diploma
       any more!  [sets fire to it and starts singing]
       I am so smart!

The fire Homer sets quickly engulfs the diploma and begins spreading to
the wall.

  Abe: [meekly] Three days!

Marge parks the car in the parking lot, and as she does, Homer sees a
nerd walk by.

Homer: [yelling at a student] Neeeerd!
Marge: Homer, that isn't very nice.
Homer: Marge, try to understand.  There are two kinds of college
       students: jocks and nerds.  As a jock, it is my duty to give

 Dean: Hi there!  Hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby.

On the first day of class, Homer sits at the back of the lecture hall.
The lecturer is an older man in a white lab coat, and he speaks with a
germanic accent.  "I see a lot of new faces," he says, "but, you know
the old saying: out with the old, in with the nucleus."  Everyone laughs
except Homer.  When the lecturer drops his cue cards by mistake, Homer's
mirth seems to know no bounds.  None of the other students see what he
finds so funny.

 Prof: {Now if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a
       comprehensive review session after every class.}

{Homer opts for chasing around a pair of squirrels with a stick instead
of staying for the (no doubt much needed) review session.}

{At home, Homer has altered his room to be more like that of a college
student.  He has posters of W. C. Fields, Einstein, and a ballerina's
feet on the wall, and he's made a makeshift bookshelf from four planks
and six cinderblocks.  He's listening to "Louie, Louie" on his stereo.}

 Marge: {Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.}
 Homer: {Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus.  Besides, it

Homer wanders the college in search of room 222, where his tutors live.
He knocks on the door and is let in.  When he greets the three nerds,
who are tapping furiously at their keyboards, they answer in robotic
voices, "Intruder Alert", and laugh.

 Homer: Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor.

to be alone in her happiness.

Nerd 2: I need to go to the bathroom!
  Lisa: We stopped five minutes ago!
Nerd 2: Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go.
-- Tension and urination just don't mix, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer still tries to figure out a way to kick-start the nerds' social
lives.  He decides a big crazy prank might do the trick: maybe rolling
the Dean up in a carpet and throwing him off a bridge?  Bart has a
better idea: pignapping the Springfield A&M mascot, Sir Oinkcelot.
Homer combines the plans, suggesting they roll the pig up in a carpet
and throw him off a bridge, but there are no takers.

Under cover of darkness, the five accomplices set out to steal Sir
Oinkcelot.  When they lug the pig back to Homer's car, Homer starts
playing with its tail, noticing that even if you pull it straight, it
curls right back up again.  He does it repeatedly until the pig chomps
on his hand in annoyance.  Homer has to be restrained from harming the
poor innocent pig.

Shortly thereafter, back at the dorm...

Nerd 1: Hey, the pig's acting kind of funny.
Nerd 2: He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor.
Nerd 3: Guys, he's really sick.
         [The pig collapses]
  Dean: [outside] Hell-oo...that sounds like a pig fainting!
-- Good ear on you, "Homer Goes to College"

Fortunately, the pig's OK.  Homer, the Dean, and the nerds watch as the
pig is airlifted to safety, tied into a harness under a helicopter.

 Dean: I'm sorry, boys, I've -- I've never expelled anyone before,
       but...that pig had some powerful friends.
Nixon: [bitterly] Oh, you'll pay.  Don't think you won't pay!
-- They are not a crook, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer is apologetic as the gates of Sprigfield College slam closed,
leaving the nerds out on the street with their suitcases.

 Homer: Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled.
Nerd 3: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Simpson, we can take care of ourselves.
         [Snake appears, holding out his hand]
 Snake: Uh, wallet inspector.
Nerd 1: Oh, here ya go.  [All three give him their wallets] I believe
        that's all in order.
 Snake: Huh ho!  I can't _believe_ that worked.
 Homer: [realization dawning] Heyy...that's not the wallet inspector!
-- Coulda been, though, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer places a worried hand to his lips, wondering what he's done.

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:59]

Homer decides the only recourse is to let them stay at the Simpson
house.  Marge doesn't look too happy about it, but Homer pleads their
case.

 Homer: Marge!  They don't have anywhere to stay.  And they're geniuses.
        they'll solve all our problems.  They'll elevate us to the
        status of kings on earth!
Nerd 3: Mr. Simpson?  We all have nosebleeds.
-- Genii non-savants, "Homer Goes to College"

The nerds sit at their computer terminals once again, only this time,
they've set them up in the Simpson's living room.  Marge idly watches
them, then remembers a phone call she has to make.  She lifts the
handset.

 Marge: [hearing modem noises] Ooh, what's wrong with this phone? it's
        making crazy noises.
Nerd 2: [contemptuously] Those "crazy noises" are computer signals.
Nerd 3: Yeah.  Some guys at MIT are sending us reasons why Captain
        Picard is better than Captain Kirk.
Nerd 1: Hah!  They're outta their minds.
-- The Great Debate continues, "Homer Goes to College"

Bart and Lisa, meanwhile, are watching the Krusty the Klown Show. it's
time for an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon: "Burning Down the Mouse".  Lisa
says she's heard about it already: "This is the one where Scratchy
finally gets Itchy!"  Bart is suitably impressed.

Itchy is tied to a stake, and he looks glum.  Scratchy rubs his hands in
delight, then reaches for a crate next to him.  He puts sticks of
dynamite under the mouse's eyelids and in his ears.  He fashions a
Lincolnian hat and beard out of plastic explosive and slaps them rudely
on Itchy, attaching grenades to his ears as crude parodies of earrings.
Itchy stares up in horror as a shadow looms over his face: Scratchy is
turning a wheel, adjusting the angle of two atomic bombs so that their
sharpened tips point directly at Itchy's eyes.  Crates of TNT are
stacked around the atomic bombs.  Lighting the fuses on all the
dynamite, he hails a taxi, and leaves.

Slowly, the fuse burns down.  Itchy tries in vain to escape, his legs
struggling.  Bart and Lisa watch, transfixed.  "My purpose in life is to
witness this moment," says Bart, grasping Lisa's hand.  We see a close-
up of Itchy's sweaty face as the inevitable draws inexorably closer.
The fuse burns all the way down, and --

Suddenly the TV screen goes blank.  Bart and Lisa scream, horrified.
One of the nerds rises from behind the TV, holding a plug in each hand.
"We need the outlet for our rock tumbler," he explains.  "Plug it in,
Plug it in!" the two cry frantically.  "What, the rock tumbler or the
TV?"  "The TV, the TV!"  The nerd makes it so.

But it is too late.  A mushroom cloud is all that's left on the TV, with
"THE END" written in red superimposed on it.  The children in Krusty's
audience cheer wildly.  "Wow!" exclaims Krusty, "They'll never let us
show that again, not in a million years!"  Bart and Lisa are aghast.

 Bart: [sharpening knives] Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes!
 Lisa: [plaintively] It's bad enough that they put their retainers in
       the dishwasher; can't we do something?
Homer: Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in
       harmony, right, Marge?
Marge: No, I want those geeks outta my house!
-- Who can argue with that?, "Homer Goes to College"

The only recourse is to get the nerds back into college, thinks Homer,
with a zany scheme of some sort.  The nerds aren't sure about the "zany"
idea, but Homer ignores them: "I got it!  We're gonna fix it so you guys
save the Dean's life!"

In the next scene, Homer is behind the wheel, driving with a determined
look on his face.  He checks his watch, seeing "4:59", and says,
"Perfect."  He fishtails around the corner.

The Dean is just leaving, closing the door on his way out.  He whistles
as he strolls down the path to the parking lot.  The nerds are hiding
behind a nearby bush.

Nerd 2: OK, guys: push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
Nerd 1: Should we correct for wind resistance?
Nerd 3: Hmm, possibly.  What do _you_ think?
         [Homer hits the Dean with his car, and the Dean goes flying]
Nerd 1: Oh, my.
-- I hope he's insured, "Homer Goes to College"

In the Springfield General Hospital, Homer and the nerds stand beside
the Dean's bed.  Homer apologizes for the "running-you-over prank", and
he admits that all the other pranks were his idea too.  "I'm the one who
should be expelled."  The Dean is touched by Homer's honesty, and he
wonders if perhaps he's been a bit of an ogre himself.  "Yes you have,"
Homer confirms quietly.

The Dean magnanimously offers to readmit the nerds and to forget that
the whole silly incident ever happened.  Just then, Dr. Hibbert walks in
with the Dean's prosthetic replacement hip.  It breaks in his hands, so
the Doctor jovially informs him he'll have to go easy on it.

The nerds move back into room 222, and check their answering machine.
"Number of messages received: zero," it says, and the three sigh with
relief.  They thank Homer for getting them back into college, and he
says, "The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."

But Homer has forgotten why he was at college in the first place: "So,
in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam," says the Nuclear
Physics 101 lecturer.  "Exam?!  This is just like one of those bad
dreams," Homer says from his seat in the back row; he then glances down,
noticing he's wearing only his underwear.

Nerd 2: What are you going to do, Mr. Simpson?
 Homer: Actually, I've been working on a plan.  During the exam, I'll
        hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will
        work out.
Nerd 2: [determined] Or, with our help, you can cram like you've never
        crammed before!
 Homer: Whatever.  Either way is good.
-- I'm not picky, "Homer Goes to College"

Homer goes to the library and takes out a wheelbarrow full of books.
The nerds tie his eyes open and hold a book in front of him.  He falls
asleep while reading another book, and one of the nerds slaps him
lightly on the cheek to wake him.  Reflexively, Homer drives his fist
into the nerd's unfortunate face, and falls back asleep.

In the exam, Homer is one of the last to leave, but he hands in his
paper with a smile, clicking his heels joyously.  The instructor glances
at his answers, and stamps a circled red "F" on his paper.

The nerds are discontented with Homer's performance.

Nerd 2: Oh, man, I can't believe you failed.
 Homer: [whining] Oh, I'm going to lose my job just 'cause I'm
        dangerously unqualified!
Nerd 2: Mr. Simpson, there is a way.  We could -- well, use a computer
        to change your grade.
 Homer: [surprised] Computers can do that?
Nerd 2: Well, yes...the only problem is the moral dilemma it raises,
        which requires --
         [Homer kisses one of the computers]
 Homer: Oh, I love -- moral whuzzah?
-- You know, ethical crisis, "Homer Goes to College"

Marge: An A+!  How did you do it?
Homer: Oh, let's just say I had help from a little magic box.
Marge: You changed your grade with a computer?
Homer: D'oh!
-- How'd she figure that out?, "Homer Goes to College"

Bart is impressed at Homer's ability, and Homer is quick to redirect
attention elsewhere.

 Homer: Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson.
        These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside
        college.
Nerd 2: No we didn't.
 Homer: Oh.  Then I learned the real value of college is to study, and
        work hard.
  Lisa: No you didn't.  You only passed your course by cheating, which
        you always taught us was wrong.
 Homer: Hmm...true.
-- The need for Debating 101, "Homer Goes to College"

Marge wants Homer to take the course over again so he can pass it
without cheating.  Homer accuses her of being worse than the crusty old
Dean.  But he sighs, accepting Marge's resolution.

Homer: Well, I guess it's back to college for me.  And that means it's
       time to -- what did I teach you guys?
Nerds: [timidly] Par - ty - down?
Homer: Yess!
-- Woo hoo!, "Homer Goes to College"

-- Episode: Homer loves Flanders
The Simpsons watch yet another edition of "Eye on Springfield", with
your host, Kent Brockman.

 Kent: Tonight, on "Eye on Springfield": just miles from your doorstep,
       hundreds of men are given weapons and trained to kill.  The
       government calls it the "army", but a more alarmist name would be
       -- "The Killbot Factory."
       But first: Springfield has come down with a fever.  Football
       fever, brought on by the biggest game of the year: the Pigskin
       Classic between the Shelbyville Sharks and our own Springfield
       Atoms.  If you have the fever, there's only one cure; take two
       tickets and see the game Sunday morning.
  Man: Warning: tickets should not be taken internally.
Homer: See?  Because of me, now they have a warning.
-- Something to be proud of, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Bart decides to take advantage of the situation.

 Bart: [sly] Hey Dad, sell you these for fifty bucks...
Homer: Woo hoo!  Sold.  [gives Bart money]
        [Bart runs off]
Marge: [tired] Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer.
Homer: What do you mean?  It says right here: "Free wig with every
       purchase of large wig.  Downtown Wig Center".  Why you little --
       hmm, free wig...
        [imagines looking at himself wearing a Marge wig]
        [falsetto] I love you, Homey.  Mmm..
        [normal voice] Heh heh, I don't need her at all any more.
-- The power of fantasy, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Homer can't resist the big game, so he camps out in front of the ticket
booth.  And his strategy pays off -- he's second in the huge line.

Homer: Heh heh heh, I did it!  Second in line, and all I had to do was
       miss eight days of work.
  Man: With the money you would have made working, you could have bought
       tickets from a scalper.
Homer: In theory, yes.  [sotto voce] Jerk.
-- Marginal productivity of labor., "Homer Loves Flanders"

The wicket opens for selling tickets.  The first man in line steps up.

  Man: Give me, er, 30,000 tickets.
Woman: That'll be $950,000 please.
  Man: Look, the thing about that is, I only got $10 on me.  Can I pay
       you the rest later?
Woman: Sure.
-- Gee, you think he's scamming you?, "Homer Loves Flanders"

The man walks off with a big stack of tickets, and the woman puts a
"Sold Out" sign in the window.  Homer sighs and slumps against the
wicket.

On the way to work.  Homer listens to KBBL.

       [sound of Bobby McFerrin song finishing]
Marty: That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, "I'm Worried (Need Money)".
       If you want tickets to the big Pigskin Classic [oinking noise]
       just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller.
Homer: Get tickets.  Must get tickets!  Find phone.  Yes!
        [arrives at work behind a line of cars]
       Ho ho, stupid sheep.
        [drives the wrong way through the gate, bursts all his tires]
Marty: Still waiting for that caller...
Homer: [runs in whimpering, grabs phone]
Marty: Oh, we have a winner!  What's your name, sir?
  Ned: Ned Flanders!
Homer: Oh, not Flanders, anybody but Flanders --
  Ned: Well, golly, if that doesn't put the "shaz" in "shazam."  Oh,
       listen: what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it
       on my income tax?
-- Goody two-shoes Ned, "Homer Loves Flanders"

In impotent rage, Homer raises his head {and hits the radio.  It flips
to a station playing Eddie Money's "Two Tickets to Paradise",
appropriately.  Homer sings along and even plays air guitar to the
guitar solo.  "Excellent guitar riff," he comments.}

That night at home, Homer laments his fate.

Homer: Why am I such a loser?  Why?
 Bart: Well, your father was a loser, and _his_ father, and his
       father...it's genetic, man.  [realizes] D'oh!
-- That's not the only genetic thing, either, "Homer Loves Flanders"

   Lisa: What's so special about this game anyway?  It's just another
         chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and
         Shelbyville.  They built a mini-mall, so we built a bigger
         mini-mall.  They made the world's largest pizza, so we burnt
         down their city hall.
  Homer: Heh heh heh.  Yeah, they swore they'd get us back by spiking
         our water supply.  But they didn't have the guts.
  Marge: [drinks tap water, sees the walls start to run]
         Ooooh.  The walls are melting again.  [giggles]
Chicken: [getting out of the oven] Personally, I think I'm overdone.
          [flies away]
-- Drugs and cooking don't mix, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Homer tries for the second last resort of the scoundrel: prayer.

Homer: God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game.
        [doorbell rings]
  Ned: Heidely-ho, neighbor.  Wanna go to the game with me?  I got two
       tick --
Homer: [slams the door] Why do you mock me, O Lord?
Marge: Homer, that's not God.  That's just a waffle that Bart tossed up
       there.
        [Marge scrapes it off into Homer's hands]
Homer: I know I shouldn't eat thee, but -- [bites] Mmm, sacrilicious.
-- No waffle too sacred, "Homer Loves Flanders"

That night, Homer sneaks over to Ned's house with a lead pipe in his
hand.

       [Homer rings Ned's doorbell]
Marge: [calling from window] Homer?
Homer: Huh?
Marge: Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his
       tickets?
Homer: Ye -- no...
  Ned: [answers door] Huh?  [Homer winds up]
Homer: Oh.  [winds down] Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game
       with you.
  Ned: Well, get out the Crayloas and color me "Tickled Pink".  Ooh,
       what's with the lead pipe, were you going to give my noggin a
       flogging?
Homer: [sheepish] Well, yeah.

-- Ned, the good sport, "Homer Loves Flanders"

At the Shelbyville stadium, Ned and Homer drive past Carl & Lenny.

Homer: [gasps] Duck!  I can't let the boys see me with you!
  Ned: What?
Homer: [grunts, pushes Ned down] Hi!
Lenny: Hey!  Look, Homer's got one of those robot cars!

the height of their athletic prowess.}

   Burns: {[to players] Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in a
          hospital who wants you to win this game.  I know because I
          crippled him myself to inspire you.}
Milhouse: {[to his parents] I hope they win, or Mr. Burns said he's
          coming back.}
-- No plan too dastardly, "Homer Loves Flanders"

{Ned and Homer take their seats.  "Well, these are amazing seats, huh,
Homer?" he asks.  Homer agrees, then blows up a beach ball.  He
announces to the crowd behind him, "Here comes fun!" and hits it back
towards them.  For his pain, someone throws a beer can at him.}

Mayor Quimby sits at the end of the same row as Ned and Homer.  He
orders two hot dogs, two sodas, and two ice cream bars.  As they are
passed along the row towards him, Homer snatches two bites from his
dogs.  When they arrive, Quimby asks menacingly, "What the hell happened
to my dogs?  I want answers!"  He and his bodyguards stand up.

Ned returns laden down with food.

Homer: Well, I guess I should pay my share.
  Ned: [laughs] Relax, Homer.  I keep telling you, you're my guest.
Homer: Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat!  Thanks, Ned.

-- Not as creative as "Baby on Board", "Homer Loves Flanders"

A bulldozer comes by to clean the big pile of garbage Homer has dumped
on the field in front of his seat.

At last, the score is 27-21 for Shelbyville, and the game is in its
final seconds.

 Stan: [calling a play] Blue 27 on three.
Homer: If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan "The Boy" Taylor.
Crowd: {Stan, Stan, he's our boy,
       If he can't do it, no one -- will.}
-- Non-intuitive nicknames, "Homer Loves Flanders"

And the ball is snapped!  A huge melee forms in front of Stan, and he
must go long to his wide receiver.  The throw is good!  But the man
covering manages to force him out of bounds right at the goal marker.
Is it good?

The referee thinks about it, then calls it...touchdown!  The crowd goes
wild.  Homer goes wild too, kissing Ned many times in his joy.  Ned
laughs uncomfortably.  "Losers!  Losers!  Kiss my big Springfield
behind, Shelbyville!"  Homer taunts.  Someone throws another beer can at
him, but he ducks and scoffs.  Someone else nails him with a whole keg,
however.

When the Atom players leave the stadium, Homer begs for an autograph.

Homer: Hey!  Somebody sign an autograph?  Please?  Somebody...sign an
       autograph?  Hey, would you sign a...You fat, stupid jerks!
        [the players turn around]
       It was him!  [points at Flanders]
 Stan: Ned?  Is that -- Ned Flanders?
  Ned: Heidely-ho, Stanster.
Homer: You know Stan Taylor?
 Stan: Know me?  Ned Flanders saved me.  I used to party all night and
       sleep with lingerie models until Ned and his bible group showed
       me that I could have more.
Homer: Professional athletes, always wantin' more.
 Stan: Ned, they gave me the game ball, but I want you to have it.
Homer: [gasps]
  Ned: Tell you what -- Homer Simpson here's just about the biggest Atom
       fan that's ever graced God's green earth.  I bet he'd enjoy it
       even more than me!
 Stan: Sure, anything for Neddy.  Here you go!
Homer: Wow.  Now I have four children.  [to ball] You will be called
       "Stitchface".
-- A rough name to start life with, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Homer admits Ned has been the nicest to him that anyone has ever been.
On the drive out of the parking lot, they see Carl and Lenny again.

  Ned: Oh, I guess it's time for me to duck again.
Homer: No!  I want everyone to know that -- [yells] this is Ned
       Flanders, my friend!
Lenny: What'd he say?
 Carl: I dunno.  Something about being gay.
-- Something like that, yeah, "Homer Loves Flanders"

When they arrive at the homeless shelter, a reverend walks up to Homer
and says, "Oh, you poor unfortunate man.  Let's get you our of those
clothes immediately.  And we'll do whatever we can about the smell."

enthusiasm!  This is front-page material."  He snaps a shot which
appears on the front page of the Springfield Shopper the next day.

Marge: Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending
       too much time with Ned?  Your family needs you too.
Homer: Oh, of _course_ you'd say something like that, Marge.  You've
       hated Ned for years!  In fact, you wanted to bash his head in
       with a pipe.
Marge: That was you!
Homer: Love, Marge.  Don't hate -- love.

 Bart: The Flanders are a bunch of geeks, man.
Homer: The Flandereses are not geeks!  -- OK, Rod and Todd are, and the
       wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low-
       key hostility -- but we've gotta give this thing a chance!  I
       want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
 Bart: No way, Jose!
Homer: Yes way!
 Lisa: Don't worry, Bart.  It seems like every week something odd
       happens to the Simpsons.  My advice is to ride it out, make the
       occasional smart-alec quip, and by next week we'll be back to
       where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.
 Bart: Ay, caramba!
 Lisa: That's the spirit.
-- Meta-humor galore, "Homer Loves Flanders"

{On the drive up, both families are crammed into Ned's station wagon.
Homer consoles, "Don't worry -- I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape.
It always makes the trip go faster."  He puts it in, and a Ronald Reagan
sample repeats, "Well, well, weh-weh-well..." Homer laughs, realizing
for the first time that Reagan did in fact say "Well" a lot.}

They arrive at the Lake.  Ned backs the boat trailer into the lake while
Homer guides him.  Homer calls for its release long before it's close to
the water, and it scrapes jarringly along the concrete.  "OK, let's go
boating!" he calls.

On the lake, Ned steers the boat with Homer & Bart, supposedly watching
Todd & Rod water-skiing.  "How are my boys doing, Homer?" asks Ned,
hoping Homer was watching them as they waterskied.  "They're fine," he
answers without looking back.  The handholds skim along the water, no
boys to be seen.

Marge: I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
 Lisa: We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Maude: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.  Our boys don't eat sugar.
Marge: But why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?
Maude: No sugar!
        [Marge and Lisa groan]
        [in the woods, in a clearing]
 Todd: Thank you, but we're not allowed.
 Bart: Aw, it's OK.  There's no sugar in Pixie Stix.

  Rod: Don't hog it all, smelly-head.
 Todd: Go to hell, zit face!

-- What was the root of all evil again?, "Homer Loves Flanders"

At dinner, Homer raises his glass.

Homer: I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the
       Simpsons and Flanders.  If this were a more perfect world, we'd
       all be known as the Flimpsons.  So here's to my best friend, Ned.
  Ned: [sighs] Well, sir...my entire family is very touched --
Homer: Food fight!
        [All the Simpsons get into it while the Flanders just get
       pelted]
Homer: [later] Whatcha doin'?
  Ned: We're heading back.  Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Homer: Oh, OK.  But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin?
  Ned: Oh, I don't know --
Homer: Too late!
  Ned: [groans] Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer
       Simpson's friendship?
        [Homer jumps the boat high out of the water right onto Ned's
       car]
Homer: Your car.  [looks at the full parking lot] Boy, what are the
       odds, huh?  [laughs]
-- "Homer Loves Flanders"

Dr. Hibbert, who is in the parking lot, offers cheers to Homer Simpson
for all his recent charity work.  Everyone cheers.  "Jeers to this rusty
tailgate," he finishes.

Ned walks up a churchtower whistling "Bringing in the Sheaves."  At the
top, he assembles a semi-automatic rifle.  "There's Homer," he says,
shooting at someone in a park, "There's Homer, too.  That's also Homer.
That's also Homer!"  But this latter target is a postal employee, who of
course has his own automatic rifle.  A gunfight breaks out.

       [Ned wakes up, gasping]
Maude: What's the matter, Ned?
  Ned: I...I think I hate Homer Simpson.
        [Homer wakes up, gasping]
Homer: Marge...I think I hate Ted Koppel!  No, wait, I find him
       informative and witty.  'Night.
-- _I'll_ sleep easier, "Homer Loves Flanders"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15:55]

As Flanders plays basketball with his kids, Homer appears through the
hedge separating the neighbor's houses.

Homer: Hey!  What's up for today, Neddy?
  Ned: Uh, er, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother.  Family
       only, you know?
Homer: Right!  No reporters.
  Ned: No, I, I...I mean just the Flanders family.
Homer: [slowly] Oh, OK.  [goes back through the hedge]
 Todd: Oh boy!  Grandma!
  Ned: We're not goin' anywhere.
 Todd: But you said --
  Ned: Er...sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, you have
       to say things that aren't exactly --
  Rod: Lies make baby Jesus cry.
-- You've been told, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Homer decides to try again later.  He walks over with two putters and
knocks on Ned's door, entreating him to go to the Pitch'N'Putt.  Just
then, Flanders smashes his car through the garage door, his family along
for the ride.  Homer chases after them, much to Rod and Todd's chagrin.
Maude begs Ned to step on it, but Ned complains, "I can't!  It's a Geo!"

Homer manages to use the putters to latch onto the trunk with the clubs,
and Ned drags him along for a while.  Fortunately, the Flanders turn a
corner sharply, dislodging Homer.  He rolls off, clanking, and as he
comes to rest, he concludes, "I guess he didn't see me."

    Ned: We did it!  We got rid of --
          [siren wails; Ned is pulled over]
    Ned: I told you, officer, I'm not "hepped up on Goofballs."
 Wiggum: [bored] Yeah, right.

Lovejoy: Ned Flanders!  I never would have imagined.
          [Ned feels weak with shame, then faints]
 Wiggum: High as a kite, everybody!  Goofballs!
          [forces him into the back of the police car]
         Yeah, where's your Messiah now, Flanders?
-- He's hepped up too, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Sunday.  Ned confesses to weak feelings as his family approaches the
First Church of Springfield.

  Ned: I can't do it, Maude.  I can't face their accusing eyes!
Maude: Oh, don't worry, Ned.  This is a house of love and forgiveness.
        [Ned opens the door]
Crowd: There he is, Ned Flanders!
       The fallen one.
       The evil one.
       Bet he's the one who wrote "Homer" all over the bathroom.
  Ned: Oh, I think we should leave.
Homer: Hey, Flanders, over here!  I got us some kick-ass seats.
-- The shame and humiliation, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Ned and his family scurry up to the front where Homer has saved them a
pew.

Lovejoy: Before I get started on today's sermon entitled, "What Ned
         Did," I'd like to congratulate Homer Simpsons on his recent
         charity work.
          [everyone claps politely]
  Homer: [kisses audience] I live to give!
Lovejoy: That's beautiful.  We appreciate the kisses.
-- "Homer Loves Flanders"

Rev. Lovejoy calls for everyone to bow their heads in a silent prayer of
thanksgiving.  Everyone does so.  But Ned can't help but be annoyed by
Homer breathing through his nose, whistling louder and louder.  "Stop
it!"  Flanders cries in anger, "Breathe through your damn mouth!"
Everyone gasps in astonishment.

         Ned: Oh, can't you see this man isn't a hero?  He's annoying.
              He's very, very annoying!
Mrs. Lovejoy: [haughty] Well.  Ned Flanders is just jealous.
         Moe: Aw, the guy's hepped up on Goofballs.
         Abe: Let's sacrifice him to our god!

              the thirties.
-- Paganism in the twentieth century, "Homer Loves Flanders"

A lynch mob takes little time to form.

  Homer: How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that.  He's a
         wonderful, kind, caring man -- maybe even more so than me.
         There have been times when I lost patience with him -- even
         lashed out at him!  -- but this man has turned every cheek on
         his body.
         If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for
         heaven: we'd already be there.
          [everyone seems sympathetic]
Lovejoy: Um...well, I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology.  We were
         wrong to doubt him.
  Lenny: Hey, that guy's right!
-- Give 'em hell, Timothy, "Homer Loves Flanders"

Marge commends Homer on what a nice thing he did.  Ned, too, is
effusively grateful.

  Ned: Thank you so much, Homer.  You're a true friend.
Homer: Right back at you, buddy.  Now how about that game at the
       Pitch'N'Putt?
  Ned: Just try and stop me.
 Bart: I don't get it, Lis.  You said everything would be back to
       normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends.
 Lisa: Yeah.  Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
        ["Next Thursday at 8:00pm"]
Homer: Guess what, everybody?  My great uncle Boris died and left us his
       old country house!  There's only one catch: they say it's
       haunted.  But I'm sure we can prove 'em wrong by spending the
       weekend there.

          Burns.
           [Everyone gasps]
   Burns: Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters
          before the start of the rainy season.  And remember, a shiny
          new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya.

          the "Worker of the Week Award".  I can't believe we've
          overlooked this week's winner for so very, very long.  We
          simply could not function without his tireless efforts.  So, a
          round of applause for...this inanimate carbon rod!

Homer is despondent that night at dinner.

Homer: Stupid carbon rod.  It's all just a popularity contest!
 Bart: Wow!  Did you actually get to _see_ the rod?
Marge: Oh, I'm sorry, Homey.
Homer: [mournful] Nobody respects me at work.

Since everyone's laughing, Homer asks, "What does it say?  I want to
see!"  He tries spinning around to see it, but only ends up falling on
the ground and gasping as he continues to run in circles.  The family's
laughter tapers off slowly.  Soon, they all groan.

Homer: Ah, TV respects me.  It laughs _with_ me, not at me!
        [Turns it on; a man points at him]
  Man: You stupid -- [laughs uncontrollably]
Homer: D'oh!  [switches channels]
-- "Deep Space Homer"

The channel Homer happened to flick to shows two men talking about the
impending launch of the space shuttle.

  Tom: It's a lovely day for a launch, here, live at Cape Canaveral, at
       the lower end of the Florida Peninsula, and the purpose of
       today's mission is truly, really electrifying.
Man 2: That's correct, Tom.  The lion's share of this flight will be
       devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny
       screws.
  Tom: Unbelievable, and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness.
       And of course, this could have literally millions of applications
       here on Earth -- everything from watchmaking to watch repair.
Homer: Boring.
        [tries to switch channels, but the batteries fall from the
       remote control]
       No!  The batteries!
  Tom: Now let's look at the crew a little.
Man 2: They're a colorful bunch.  They've been dubbed "the Three
       Musketeers".  Heh heh heh --
  Tom: And we laugh legitimately.  There's a mathematician, a different
       _kind_ of mathematician, and a statistician.
Homer: Make it stop!  [panics]
 Bart: Oh no, not another boring space launch.  Change the channel.
       Change the channel!

Assistant: Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret: that all

Assistant: Well, here are the most popular personalities on television,

[End of Act One.  Time: 6:05]

Homer drags his whole family down to Florida in a Beverly Hillbillies-
style junker.  They arrive at a gate through which a guard motions them.

The scientist has called a press conference.  He stands at a podium on a
stage in front of red curtains.

           will be no more beer.

Marge: You know, Homer, when I found out about this, I went through a

       then concerned, but now I realize that being a spaceman is

The next day, Homer shows up for training eating a pink donut.  (But not

-- Let's not complete that limerick, "Deep Space Homer"

Both men are tested on the centrifugal force machine, their faces taking
on obscene-looking shapes (Homer's remarkably reminiscent of Popeye).
They both blow into small tubes connected to columns filled with water
and a white ball, to test the strength of their lungs.  Homer drinks his
water instead, sighing, "Mmm...mediciney."  {They are even forced to do
battle in a futuristic arena while everyone watches.  The assistant
whispers, "I wager 400 quatloos on the newcomer."}

Scientist: Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the two experienced
           astronauts who will accompany the winner into space: Race

     Buzz: {Second comes right after first.

           So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
    Homer: [contemptuous] I, er, don't think this contest is over yet,
           "Buzz"...if that _is_ your real name.  I believe there is
           still a little something called "The Swimsuit Competition".
Scientist: There's no swimsuit competition, Homer.
    Homer: [voice rising] You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
-- That's what he means, "Deep Space Homer"

At last, the big day arrives.  Barney does somersaults while holding
onto some gymnast's rings as Homer stands there.  The scientist and his
assistant approach, and Barney does a perfect dismount.

Scientist: Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard.  And in a way,
           you're both winners.  But in another more accurate way,
           Barney is the winner.
    Homer: [downcast] Congratulations, Barney.
Scientist: That's very gracious of you, Homer.  Please join us in a
           toast...to the mission!
            [The four of them drink, and Barney looks slightly crazed]
   Barney: It begins...[grabs the bottle and chugs]
-- So close and yet so far, "Deep Space Homer"

The two men try to restrain Barney, but he breaks free and runs for a
rocket backpack.  Drunkenly yodeling a fanfare, he straps it on and
blasts off.  But it runs out of fuel in midair.  Barney bounces
repeatedly off the corrugated metal roof of a pillow factory, then lands
in the middle of the road, only to be run over by a marshmallow truck.
"I don't understand it," says the assistant, "that was non-alcoholic
champagne."

Scientist: [resigned] Well, Homer, I guess you're the winner by default.
    Homer: Default?  Woo hoo!  The two sweetest words in the English
           language: de-fault!  De-fault!  De-fault!

licking his fingers as he swallows it whole.  But his stomach starts to
bulge out, and he screams as Itchy breaks through, holding the
undigested sandwich.  Out of spite, Itchy eats the sandwich himself and
tosses the cat in the airlock, pressing the button to blow him into
space.  Luckily, Scratchy is prepared, and he snaps his space suit
helmet on just as he is ejected.

Floating free in space doesn't save him, however.  Itchy goes out in a
space pod with arms and giggles, grabbing Scratchy's body.  He carries
the body up to the rings of a nearby planet and saws the unfortunate cat
in half.  Scratchy chases after his lower half, but it burns up as it
enters the planet's atmosphere.  He shrugs, but Itchy flies up to him,
grabs his torso, and removes his helmet.  His head enlarges in the
vacuum, and Itchy bursts it with a pin.  "THE END" appears on the screen
in Scratchy's blood.

Announcer: The preceding program contained scenes of extreme violence
           and should not have been viewed by young children.
            [Bart and Lisa cackle with mirth]
-- Pointless disclaimers after Itchy and Scratchy, "Deep Space Homer"

Homer sweats as his children laugh.

Next, we see a shot of Homer, Race, and Buzz, all wearing their space
suits, striding towards us down a hall.  They approach the shuttle in
which they'll be flying.  Homer looks up at it with awe, and becomes
frightened.  "Noooo!" he yells, then runs back down the hall, panting.
He loses his nerve and calls Marge.

Homer: Marge...I don't really want to go through with this.  But being
       an astronaut is how I got you to respect me!
Marge: Homer, when I met you, you weren't an astronaut.  You didn't even
       know how to use a touchtone, but I _still_ respected you and I
       always will, no matter what.
        [touchtone sounds come from the phone]
       Homer, you already dialed.
-- I can't believe they invented it, "Deep Space Homer"

Marge: But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an
       opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your
       life.
Homer: You're right, Marge.  Just like the time I could have met Mr. T
       at the mall.  The entire day I kept saying, "I'll go a little
       later.  I'll go a little later."  And then when I got there, they
       told me he'd just left.  And when I asked the mall guy if he
       would ever come back again, he said he didn't know.  Well, I'm
       never going to let something like that happen again!  I'm going
       into space right now!
Marge: Oh, I am so proud of you.  And I know it's going to go just fine
       --
        [touchtone sounds come from the phone]
       Mmm...
-- I still can't believe they invented it, "Deep Space Homer"

At the Cape, a voice announces, "T minus three minutes till liftoff and
counting."

      Buzz: Mission Control, this is Corvair.  Launch sequence
            initiated.  All systems go.
     Homer: Are we there yet?  I'm thirsty.
      Race: Mission Control, request permission to sedate cargo ahead of
            schedule.
Controller: Permission denied.
-- Busted!, "Deep Space Homer"

Race: Payload checklist.  IRS surveillance satellite --
Buzz: Check.
Race: Ant farm --
Buzz: Check.
Race: Children's letters to God --
Buzz: Check.
-- Only the essentials on _this_ mission, "Deep Space Homer"

The voice counts down, "Three, two, one, make rocket go now!"  It lifts
off.  The G forces are very strong, and they cause Homer to take on a
Nixon-like appearance briefly.

Marge, her sisters, Grampa, and the kids all watch at home.

    Bart: Go, Dad, go!
    Lisa: "How doth the hero strong and brave,
          A celestial path in the heavens pave."
Everyone: Huh?
    Lisa: [quiet] Go, Dad, go.
-- No time for eloquence, "Deep Space Homer"

Good news at Mission Control, too.

Assistant: Sir, the TV ratings for the launch are the highest in ten
           years.
 Everyone: Yay!
Scientist: And how's the spacecraft doing?
Assistant: I dunno.  All this equipment is just used to measure TV
           ratings.
-- Equipment purchased at the taxpayers' expense, "Deep Space Homer"

It's beautiful.  It's the most awe-inspiring sight I have ever seen.
Giver of life, mother of us all...hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard!
[shows a bag of chips]
-- Homer, just after lift-off, "Deep Space Homer"

Buzz warns him, "Homer, no!"  But it's too late: Homer opens the bag
nonetheless.  The chips float about the cabin, and Race rues, "They'll
clog the instruments!"  Buzz is worried: "Careful!  They're ruffled."
Homer has the solution, however; he unbuckles his seat belt, and
accompanied by "The Blue Danube Waltz", he floats about the cabin,
eating the chips.  But his head drifts perilously close to the ant
colony.

Ant 1: Protect the queen!
Ant 2: Which one's the queen?
Ant 3: I'm the queen!
Ant 1: No you're not!
Homer: Nooo!  [his head smashed the colony, and the ants float free]
Ant 1: Freedom!  Horrible, horrible freedom!
 Buzz: You fool!  Now we may never know if ants can be trained to sort
       tiny screws in space.
-- The bane of humanity, "Deep Space Homer"

Controller: Er, some good news, gentlemen.  We have quite a treat for
            you.  We've been able to coax superstar James Taylor in here
            to Mission Control to wish you well and play you a little
            bit of his own brand of laid-back adult contemporary music.
     Homer: Wow, former president James Taylor.
    Taylor: How ya doin', fellas?
      Buzz: With all due respect, Mr. Taylor, this isn't the best time
            for your unique brand of bittersweet folk rock.  We have a
            potentially critical situation here.  I'm sure you'll
            understand.
    Taylor: Listen, Aldrin, I'm not as laid back as people think.  Now
            here's the deal: I'm going to play, and you're going to
            float there and like it.
             [sings]
            When you're down, and troubled,
            And you need a helping hand,
            And nothing, oh, nothing is going right...
-- Strangely apt choice of lyrics, "Deep Space Homer"

Kent Brockman reports on Channel Six.

    Kent: We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the
          spacecraft with "average-naut" Homer Simpson, and we'd like to
          -- aah!
           [Camera shows a close-up of an ant floating in front of the
          three astronauts]
Everyone: Aah!
    Kent: Ladies and gentlemen, er, we've just lost the picture, but,
          uh, what we've seen speaks for itself.  The Corvair spacecraft
          has been taken over -- "conquered", if you will -- by a master
          race of giant space ants.  It's difficult to tell from this
          vantage point whether they will consume the captive earth men
          or merely enslave them.  One thing is for certain, there is no
          stopping them; the ants will soon be here.
          And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.  I'd like to
          remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful
          in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar
          caves.
   Marge: Mmm, don't worry, kids.  I'm sure your father's all right.
    Lisa: What are you basing that on, Mom?
           [pause]
   Marge: [with forced cheer] Who wants ginger snaps?
-- I do!  Me too, please!, "Deep Space Homer"

James Taylor continues to sing to the hapless astronauts.  "{There's
hours of time on the telephone line,/Talking 'bout things to
come.}/Sweet dreams, and flying machines,/And pieces on the ground --
um..." He pauses, then continues, "Sweet dreams, and flying
machines,/Flying safely through the air..."

Things go from bad to worse on the spaceship.  Some of the ants land on
the controls and crawl into them.

     Race: Oh my God, the ants are shorting out our navigation systems!
            [the astronauts smack back and forth into the walls]
   Taylor: Ants, huh?  We had quite a severe ant problem at the vineyard
           this year.  I had Art Garfunkel come by with his compressor,
           and we created a total vacuum outside the house, and we blew
           the ants out the front door.  But I'm sure you high-tech NASA
           people could care less about our resort-town ways.
Assistant: [menacing] Quiet, you --
Scientist: Wait a minute...this unkempt youngster might just be on to
           something.
-- Unkempt?  Young?  Naah, "Deep Space Homer"

Race and Buzz prepare the shuttle to be evacuated of air.  Buzz pushes
the button with a "Make hatch blow now!"  The ants and chips get sucked
out, as planned, and Homer (who has forgotten to attach his seat belt)
dusts off his hands, says, "And that is that!"  He, too, gets sucked
towards the hatch.

Luckily, he manages to grab the handle of the door, but it bends under
the strain.  "Oh my God," says the scientist, "this is a disaster!"
James Taylor uses the distraction to run away.

Homer hangs outside the shuttle still, and the handle finally gives in
and snaps off.  Fortunately, Buzz and Race are there to grab him.

 Buzz: Homer, you broke the handle.
 Race: With that hatch open, we'll burn up on re-entry!  That's it: if I
       go, I'm taking you to hell with me.
Homer: Wait a minute, Race.  Wait a minute...wait!
        [breaks off a support rod]
       Aha!  Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours!
        [tries to swing it, but it catches in the door]
       Aw, stupid bar.
 Buzz: Wait, Homer.  If that bar holds, we just might make it back to
       earth.
Homer: Oh.  [voice rising] I'll bash you good!
-- One-track minds, "Deep Space Homer"

Well, this reporter was...possibly a little hasty earlier and would like
to...reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president.
May not be perfect, but it's still the best government we have.  For
now.
 [notices "HAIL ANTS" sign taped up, tears it down]
Oh, yes, by the way, the spacecraft still in extreme danger, may not
make it back, attempting risky reentry, bla bla bla bla bla bla.  We'll
see you after the movie.
-- Kent Brockman, backpedaling furiously, "Deep Space Homer"

On the dangerous trip back through the atmosphere, the shuttle heats up
until it glows red.  Buzz and Race hum, "The Battle Hymn of the
Republic," while Homer sings, "Oh, those Golden Grahams.  Oh, those
Golden Grahams.  Crispy, crunchy, graham cereal, brand new breakfast
treat..."

The Simpson family still watch in suspense.

Lisa: Come on, Dad.  You can make it!
 Abe: Aw, of course he'll make it.  It's TV.
-- Metahumor, "Deep Space Homer"

The spaceship hurtles towards the earth at a dangerous speed.  It
smashes into the building where the press is housed, which is convenient
in terms of post-trip interviews.

     Tom: Uh, how'd you solve the door dilemma?
    Buzz: Homer Simpson was the real hero here.  He jury-rigged the door
          closed using this.
   Man 1: Hey, what is that?
   Man 2: It's an inanimate carbon rod!
Everyone: Yay!
           [Time magazine cover: "In Rod We Trust"]
-- Rod Flanders?  Nope, "Deep Space Homer"

A parade is organized in honor of the rod.  It gets to ride in its own
limousine.  The family watch the parade, but Homer turns the TV off
angrily.

       [Homer shuts off the TV]
 Bart: Aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!
Homer: Oh, stupid rod!  I got gypped.
Marge: Oh, Homey, you should be proud!  Only a handful of people have
       done what you've done.
 Lisa: Yeah, Dad!  How many people have seen the icecaps and the deserts
       all at once, or the majesty of the Northern Lights from one
       hundred miles above?
Homer: Yeah, maybe I do have the right...what's that stuff?
-- Uh, stuff?, "Deep Space Homer"

Homer thanks his wife and elder daughter.  "Bart, do you have something
nice to say to your father?"  Bart, who has just written "HERO" on
Homer's head, says, "Ehh, he knows how I feel."  He tosses the marker in
the air, and we watch it close up, tumbling slowly.

It turns into a FOX satellite in space, descending slowly to "Also
Sprach Zarathustra".  It hits a glass ball containing a baby Homer in
it, who says, "D'oh!" indignantly.

-- Episode: Homer the Smithers
It seems that Mr. Burns is holding yet another employees-wife-and-no-
more-than-three-children night, this time at the Springfield Dragway.

Smithers: [on mike] Testing, testing for Mr. Burns.
          [to Burns] Here you go, sir, I've warmed up the crowd for
          you.
   Burns: [in a wooden voice] Welcome employees. Come in!
           [Smithers holds him a card]
          The whole night's entertainment is on me.
           [takes another card] Monty Burns!
          [all cheer]
-- Burns' moving speech, "Homer the Smithers"

Everybody takes their seats, Homer wearing a huge foam hat.

Announcer: Welcome, welcome, welcome to an evening of exciting
           quarter-mile action, action, action! Our first race is a
           benefit for daredevil Lance Murdoch, Murdoch, Murdoch, who's
           hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver, liver, liver!
            [crowd cheers]
    Homer: All right! Liver!
-- Ask the connoisseur, "Homer the Smithers"

Two hot rods take place on the starting line.  Marge admires the 
hot rods and asks the kids, "Boy, it sure would be fun to car-pool
in one of those, huh kids?  I'd be a real hot rod mama, wouldn't I?
Huh?"  Bart responds with "You missed the race, mama."  Marge watches
the cars cross the finish line. "Mmm, I wish I'd pay more attention."

Meanwhile, Smithers is giving Burns a teaspoon of Duff.

   Burns: Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger
          or funkier.
Smithers: I'll switch to the tablespoon, sir.
-- As long as the bubbles don't burn your tongue, "Homer the Smithers"

Announcer: Coming up next, our feature race: the Nuclear Power Plant
           Championship. Plant plant!
    Burns: Ah, at last. Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars.
            [watches the 2-second race]
    Burns: Oh, damnation, tell them to go slower!
 Smithers: Yes sir.
            [meets the drivers]
           Hi guys. Uh, can we keep it in first gear for a couple laps?
            [they take off again, at an awfully low speed]
    Burns: [excited] Go! Go!
           [mean] Slow down.
            [the two drivers reluctantly look at each other, but do so]
            [after crossing the line, they release their parachutes,
             which don't even open]
    Burns: Excellent.
-- After all, I paid for this, "Homer the Smithers"

The night is over and everyone walks away. Smithers is about to drive
Burns home, but is asked to change his #1 "novelty foam hand" for a
smaller one, as it is "ludicrously oversized".


As Smithers goes away, Lenny happens to walk by and decides to thank
his boss.

   Lenny: [drunk] Eh, Burnsie. This was some swell shindig. Thank you
          very much!
   Burns: [frightened] Smithers, what's happening?
   Lenny: [even drunker] I had a great time. I just want to shake your
          hand.
           [Terrorized, Burns rolls up the window]
          [his face stuck on the window] You're the greatest!
   Burns: Smithers, help!
-- The dangers of holding employees nights, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers comes back to save Burns and escorts Lenny away, but cannot
prevent him from turning back and giving a thumbs up to his boss. A
frightening view.


Along on the road, Burns comes out from under the seat.

   Burns: You should've seen the murderous glint in his eyes, Smithers.
          And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeled bread.
Smithers: I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault.
   Burns: Don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly, I always
          had my mace.
Smithers: Don't let me off the hook that easily, sir. I failed you and
          I'll never forgive myself.
          [bangs his head on the steering wheel] Never, never, never...
           [Burns rolls up the window between himself and Smithers]
          [muffled] Never, never, never...
           [phone ringing]
          [on phone] Never, never, never!
-- Loyal and persistent, "Homer the Smithers"

The next morning, at Burns' office.

Smithers: Good morning, sir! To make up for my failure last night, I
          alphabetized your breakfast; you can start with the waffles
          and work your way up to the zwieback. And, to prevent
          newsprint from rubbing off on your hands, I've laminated
          today's newspaper.
   Burns: I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How
          am I supposed to do the Junior Jumble?
Smithers: Oh, I can't even grovel properly! I'm a buffoon! I don't
          deserve to live on your planet anymore!
-- By all means necessary, "Homer the Smithers"

He swipes the head off the water fountain and proceeds to try to
drown himself. Fortunately for him, Burns drains all the water by
holding down the cold water button.

   Burns: Pull yourself together, man. I daresay you're in need of a
          long vacation.
Smithers: No! Don't make me take a vacation! Without you I'll wither
          and die!
   Burns: That's a risk I'm willing to take.
-- Nothing can stop him, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers: But what would you do without me, sir?
   Burns: Thuh! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me.
          [burps] You see?
-- You made your point, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns: Now, I insist that you take a vacation, just as soon as a
       temporary substitute can be found.
        [leads Smithers to the door and closes it]
       [from behind the door] Sheesh.
-- Smithers is overworked, "Homer the Smithers"

That night, Smithers stays late at his office, busy working on his
computer.

Smithers: I've got to find a replacement that won't outshine me.
          Perhaps if I searched the employee evaluations for the word
          [types] "Incompetent"...
           [computer reports: 714 matches found]
          714 names? Better be more specific. [keeps typing] "lazy",
          "clumsy", "dim-witted", "monstrously ugly"
           [computer searches, then reports: 714 matches found]
          Oh, nuts to this! I'll just go get Homer Simpson.
-- His reputation precedes him, "Homer the Smithers"

       could give your career a real shot in the arm.
 Lisa: Mom, I just said that.
Marge: [sarcastically] Soooorry! Next time get your own darn corn.
-- Broken Record time, "Homer the Smithers"

The next day, at SNPP, Homer is getting used to Smithers' office.

   Homer: Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?
Smithers: Yeah.
           [Homer plays with the chair]
          Now, I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job,
          but... actually it's just 2,800 small jobs.
   Homer: Uh huh. But this _is_ the chair, right?
Smithers: Your new duties will include: answering Mr. Burns' phone,
          preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting
          with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some
          light typing.
-- Typing? My whole plan down the--, "Homer the Smithers"

The phone rings...

Smithers: [answering] Montgomery Burns' office. Oh, hello Mrs. Burns.
          I'll see if your son is available.
   Homer: Mr. Burns has a mother? She must a hundred million years old!
Smithers: She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell.
-- Does she watch `Matlock'?, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers: I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a
          very important meeting and can't be disturbed.

-- A rested plant owner is a vigilant plant owner, "Homer the Smithers"          
          
Smithers: Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave
          her for having that affair with president Taft.
   Homer: [chuckles] Taft, you old dog.
-- "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers is brushing Burns' teeth.

   Burns: [spits] Really Smithers, I'll be fine. I'm sure your
          replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he,
          anyway?
Smithers: Uh, Homer Simpson, sir. One of your organ banks from sector
          7-G. All the recent events of your life have revolved around
          him in some way.
   Burns: Simpson, eh?
-- Rings a bell?, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers is packing his luggage in the airport van.

   Homer: [yelling from his window] Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't
          understand 2,700 of my new duties.
Smithers: Well, the van's leaving; which one duty is giving you the
          most trouble?
   Homer: Um... what do I do in case of fire?
Smithers: [muffled from inside the van] Sorry, can't hear you. Bye!
           [the van leaves]
   Homer: [sits, then looks at Mr. Burns' office burning down]
          Aw, just my luck.
-- When the fire starts to burn..., "Homer the Smithers"

[End of Act One.  Time: 6'19"]


Homer manages to get a hold on a fire extinguisher and put out the
fire.

Burns: [gasps at his sight] Good Lord, Smithers, you look atrocious. I
       thought I told you to take a vacation.
Homer: Uh, Smithers already left, sir. I'm his replacement, Homer
       Simpson.
Burns: Ah yes, Simpson.
-- Well, they both have four fingers, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns: I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of Shredded Wheat, some
       steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
Homer: But I think the dodo went extinct...
Burns: Get going! And answer those phones, install the computer system,
       and rotate my office so the window faces the hills.
Homer: [taking notes] Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay. Um, can you repeat the part
       of the stuff where you said all about the... things. Uh... the
       things?
        [Burns looks at him meanly]
-- Efficiency at its best, "Homer the Smithers"

Next morning, Homer wakes up at 4:30, and tries to put on his pants.
Fitting his left leg into the pants' right leg poses no problem, but
the absence of any possible way of reaching his goal from this very
situation engenders a paradox too complex for his neural activity at
this hour.

Lousy two-legged pants.
-- Homer's deep reflexions at 4:30, "Homer the Smithers"

Marge: Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. Little Rascals isn't until 6.
Homer: I know, I'm taping it. I want to get to Burns' house bright and 
       early to make his breakfast.
Marge: Hmm, poor Homie. Poor, poor... [snores]
-- How compassionate, "Homer the Smithers"

Homer walks in Burns' kitchen, and is lost by the diversity and
complexity of all the equipment. "Hmm... one of these must be a
breakfast maker," he wonders. Homer gets into the spirit: "Well, it's
my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damn
breakfast he ever ate." He tries to cook a shish kebab on the burner,
but is puzzled when the whole thing ends up in flames. As his next
attempt, he breaks the window of the microwave door, and inserts
another shish kebab. The waves going through his arm don't seem to
affect him, but this time it's the microwave which is burning. As a
last resort, he pours some Corn Flakes and milk in a bowl, and gets
annoyed when this breakfast ends up in the same way as his previous
attempts.


He finally comes up with a solution.

Doughnuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food!
-- Mr. Burns, commenting on Homer's breakfast, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns: Here, tell me how my stocks did yesterday.
Homer: Uh... they all won.
Burns: What about my options?
Homer: Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.
Burns: I believe I'll get up.
-- Still needs to study `Advanced Marketing', "Homer the Smithers"

Comes bath time...

Burns: Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off.
Homer: [groans]
-- Burns' personal hygiene, "Homer the Smithers"

Then it's denture-choosing time: "I think... the fangs today." Homer
inserts the fanged denture, and Burns' jaw hangs in the air until
Homer pushes it up.


Later that day...

Burns: [from his office] Simpson? Simpson?
        [walks into Smithers' office]
       Did you get that report on the accounting department?
Homer: Yes sir, I did.
       [reads] "The accounting department is located on the 3rd floor.
       Its hours are 9am to 5pm. The head of this department is a Mr.
       Johnson or Johnstone."
-- `My report', by Homer Simpson, "Homer the Smithers"

Yet a little later...

Homer: Here are your messages:
       "You have 30 minutes to move your car",
       "You have 10 minutes",
       "Your car has been impounded",
       "Your car has been crushed into a cube",
       "You have 30 minutes to move your cube".
        [phone ringing]
Homer: [answers] Yello, Mr. Burns' office.
Burns: Is it about my cube?
-- More of a Frinkahedron, "Homer the Smithers"

   Homer: It's Mr. Smithers, he's calling for you.
Smithers: [on a beach] How's everything going there, sir? Well, I have
          a lot of... free time on my hands. If you FedEx me your mail
          I'd be happy to open it and return it to you.
   Burns: Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to
          be getting dumber by the minute, I've never seen anything
          quite like it. Anywho, you just enjoy your vacation.
   Homer: [moans]
-- Nothing like being appreciated at work, "Homer the Smithers"

That night at home, Homer can't keep his eyes open.

Homer: [snores]
 Bart: Look alive, Simpson, I'm not paying you to goldbrick.
Homer: [wakes up] Uh... Yes sir.
 Bart: Now get cracking on my long division, and don't forget to show
       your work, Simpson.
Homer: I'll have it on your desk tomorrow morning, sir.
 Lisa: Bart, leave Simpson alone! [whispering to Homer] Simpson, I need
       a ride to the library.
Homer: Yes sir.
Marge: Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down
       and relax?
Homer: No time, Marge. I thing Mr. Burns wants me to do some long
       division.
Marge: [authoritatively] Simpson, lie down!
        [Homer does so]
       Sorry, but you need a good night's rest.
-- More obedient than the dog, "Homer the Smithers"

As Homer sighs in relief and enjoys his rest, a loud bell can be
heard, with Burns yelling "Simpson!".


Homer rushes in Burns' manor, where Burns is ringing a tiny bell in a
giant megaphone.

   Burns: The telephone has been ringing for some time.
          [severely] Answer it.
   Homer: [answers] Yello.
          [to Burns] It's for you.
Smithers: [on a public phone] Mr. Burns, 48 rings, are you all right?
          What did Simpson do to you?
   Burns: Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his
          incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything, a complete
          moron!
           [Homer is still holding the phone]
          But I'm not really free to talk right now.
          Look, stop calling me and enjoy your vacation. And remember,
          I want to see lots of pictures when you get back.
Smithers:  [obviously calling from a "men only" bar]
          Uh, actually sir, picture-taking is not allowed at this...
          particular resort.
           [a conga line of men forms behind him]
          Oop, I gotta go now, there's a line forming behind me.
           [joins in]
-- Nah, it can't be what it seems, "Homer the Smithers"

Homer reluctantly walks into another typical day in the life of 
Burns' assistant.  Burns turns on his desk lamp and is blinded.
"60 watts! What do you think this is, a tanning salon?", he yells.

At night, in bed, Burns' nightcap is solidified into a cone, thanks 
to Homer forgetting to use light starch, and Burns yells while
poking Homer with it.

He just never can be satisfied...

Burns:  [throws his glass at Homer]
       You call this Postum?
        [bashes a 5-feet high pile of paper]
Burns: You call this a tax return?
        [bangs a CRAY with his cane]
Burns: You call this a supercomputer?
-- Our referee in the Win 95 vs. OS/2 struggle, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns keeps yelling and throwing things at Homer, who can stands no
more; after a long yell of despair, he smashes his fist in Burns'
face, sending him to the floor. Realizing what he's done, he whimpers
in fear before he runs off home, shuts the door and sits against it.

Marge: Is there something wrong, Homie?
Homer: No.
Marge: Except?
Homer: Except... I killed Mr. Burns!
-- Just asking, "Homer the Smithers"

 Lisa: What happened, Dad?
Homer: I punched Burns right in his 104-year-old face.
 Lisa: Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really really hurt him.
Marge: Okay, maybe everything's all right, maybe if you go apologize he
       won't even fire you. If he's alive.
-- That's what the `better hospitals' are for, "Homer the Smithers"

Homer knocks on the door at Burns' office, but gets no response. It
seems to be empty, yet some rapsy breathing can be heard. After
looking around, Homer pokes behind a plant, and sees Burns hiding.
Both gasp at each other's sight.

Homer: I'm really sorry I hit you Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt
       on that eye.
Burns: [frightened] No, please, I can't bear another trashing. Just
       leave me be!
Homer: Yes sir...
        [walks away]
Burns: Must call Smithers, he'll protect me from this beast.
        [looks at his phone]
       I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't
       seem to be any trick to it. Let's see, Smithers...
       S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S. Success, it's ringing!
  Moe: Moe's tavern.
Burns: I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers, first name Waylon.
  Moe: Oh... So you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name
       Waylon is it? Listen to me, you! When I catch you, I'm gonna
       pull out your eyes, and shove 'em down your pants, so you can
       watch kick the crap outta you, okay? Then I'm gonna use your
       tongue to paint my boat!
-- The hunter has become the hunted, "Homer the Smithers"

Burns puts the receiver in a drawer, locks it, and sits back behind
the plant.  He bemoans his fate.  "Oh, Smithers, if you could only
hear me..."  Back at the resort, Smithers senses these words and
stops driving his boat, sending a pyramid of water-skiing men into
it.

Burns slides a mirror under the door to monitor the enemy...

Burns: Praise God. I think the thug has finally gone home for the day.
       Now, I can make my escape...
Homer: [shows into the mirror] Hi, Mr. Burns! You want your coffee now?
Burns: Uh, no. I'm making it myself!
        [takes a coffeepot, rattles it]
       Hear that? The percolations are imminent. No need to come in.
       Uh... cease your ingress!
-- Whatever that means it ain't good, "Homer the Smithers"

Homer walks in later, to see Burns surrounded by coffee, sacks and
beans spilled almost everywhere.

Burns: Stay back Homer, approach no further, coffee's already made. I
       stomped the beans myself.
Homer: Uh, well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's 5:00.
Burns: No! I thought, uh, I thought I'd chauffeur myself this evening.
       Yes, that's what I thought. How difficult could it be? I'm sure
       the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator and
       which the deceleratrix, hmm?
-- Yeah, somewhere on the back, "Homer the Smithers"

Behind the steering wheel, Burns drives recklessly while slowly
learning that he enjoys doing things for himself, wrecking several
things and nearly crashing into Chief Wiggum, who congratulates Burns
on his reckless driving.

The next day at the office, it's a new Mr. Burns who shows up.

Homer: Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you,
       sir?
Burns: Already taken care of.
        [shreds the reports and throw them out the window]
Burns: [chuckles] Capucino, Simpson?
        [phone ringing]
       [answers] Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is
       4-2-*4*-6. I suspect you need more practice working your
       telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy!
Homer: Uh, Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?
Burns: No, Homer, you've already done more for me than any man. Your
       brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that
       being waited on hand and foot is OK for your average Joe, but
       it's not for me.
-- But at least you can afford it, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers comes just in time to see Burns hugging and thanking Homer.

Smithers: Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have left...
   Burns: Ah, welcome back Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson, he
          pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang-up
          job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in
          sector 7-G.
Smithers: [sighs in relief] You heard the man, Simpson.
   Burns: Ah, and my dear dear Smithers. You're no longer needed at
          all.
          You're fired. Ta!
   Homer: [to Smithers] *You* shouldn't have gone away in vacation.
-- Then who'll release the hounds?, "Homer the Smithers"

[End of Act Two.  Time: 15'41"]


At home, OFF is yet again chomping that so-called food of theirs.

Marge: Cheer up, Homie.
Homer: I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job
       was all he had. Imagine how _you'd_ feel Marge if you got fired
       from the... those... things that... you do.
Bart: Quick Mom, whip up a cake before Dad fires ya!
-- She can still take back her job at Mr. Burger, "Homer the Smithers"

But Lisa comforts him: "Mr. Smithers is a resilient man, I'm sure he
can get a great job at any corporation he wants."


And indeed, he is about to enter the AT&T office -- which reveals to
be NEAT & TIDY: Piano Movers. "Meet your new piano mover" he says,
followed by his predictable visit to the hospital.  Hibbert tells
Smithers that he'll need a steel rod for a spine.

Next try is the Springfield Dragway.

Smithers: [on mike] Get ready for exciting quarter-mile action at the
          Springfield Dragway. It'll be motorized mayhem mayhem mayhem.
          [softly] Do we need all those "mayhems"? We do. All right,
          fair enough. I suppose you know your business.
          [loud] Get ready for fun, fun, fun!
          [soft] I... The people are already here, we don't... need to
          keep hustling them like this, do we?
          [angrily] Let go of me... Where are you throwing me?
           [trash noises]
-- You're fired, fired, fired!, "Homer the Smithers"

And guess where he ends up?  At Moe's Tavern.

Smithers: Uh, hello. You got a "Help Wanted" sign on the window?
     Moe: Yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer
          delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely
          off the truck.
Smithers: I'll just... wait out back until then.
  Barney: I look forward to working with you!
-- Does it takes credentials?, "Homer the Smithers"

But Homer knows him better. "You can give up on yourself, and take
the Barney-guarding job like so many have contemplated in our darkest
moments, or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that
can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
Smithers admits he's right, but he's going to need Homer's help.
Their conversation is interrupted by the 12 strokes of midnight.
"Oh my God!" Moe yells, as the beer delivery truck is ransacked by
Barney.  Moe can't bear to watch.

At SNPP, Homer and Smithers are preparing their plan.  Smithers is
planning to make Burns talk to his mother, whom he hates, and when
she tears into him, Smithers will save the day.

So Smithers calls Mrs. Burns.

Mrs. Burns: [on phone] Whot?
  Smithers: Hello, Mrs. Burns? This is Waylon Smithers. I have your son
            Montgomery on the line...
Mrs. Burns: That improvident lackwit? Always too busy stridin' about
            his atom mill to call his own mother. I'll give him
            what-fors 'till he cries brassafrax!
-- We finally know where he gets it from, "Homer the Smithers"

Smithers puts her on hold.

Smithers: [chuckles] Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the
          call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him I'll rush in and
          save the day.
   Homer: Got it.
          [pushes Speaker] I'm transfering a call in to you, Mr. Burns.
   Burns: [on intercom] No problemo!
   Homer: [hesitating between the four buttons] Uh... Ooh... Uh...
           [pushes Disconnect]
          [hearing the dial tone] Oh oh.
   Burns: [from his office] Ahoy-hoy? Hoy?
   Homer: [in falsetto] Hello Mr. Burns? This is your mother.
Smithers: [whispering] No...
   Burns: Urg... Oh, hello mater. Um... sorry about pulling the plug on
          you and all, uh... who could've known you'll pull through
          and... live... for another 5 decades? Ohh, is my face red!
Smithers: [to Homer] Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more
          dessicated. And she doesn't call her son "Mr. Burns"!
   Homer: [cracking falsetto] Son, this is Mrs. Burns. I just called to
          say I don't love you. You are a bad son Montel...
   Burns: [behind him] So...
   Homer: [screams]
   Burns: Impersonate my mother, will you? And you Smithers, you must
          have put him up to it. I'm glad I fired you.
   Homer: Ya really blew it this time, Smithers.
-- I didn't do it, "Homer the Smithers"

--Episode: Telltale Head
 The mob closes in, and Bart climbs to the top of the statue.
   
   Bart:   Murderous mob, I beg you to spare our lives, at least until you've
           heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our belov\'ed
           town founder.
   Barney: How long will this story take?
   Bart:   Uh... About twenty-three minutes and five seconds.
   -- Does that include commercials?  ``The Telltale Head''
   
 They agree. It all started Sunday morning.  Marge calls the kids downstairs.
 The three kids come down, all dressed adorably.  (Bart uses the banister
 express.)  Marge gives them a quick inspection.
   
   Marge: Bart, assume the position.
   Bart:  [turns and leans against the wall, legs spread]
   Marge: [frisks Bart]
   -- Leaving for church, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 Marge finds a slingshot and a Radioactive Man comic.  Meanwhile, Homer
 hops nervously on the couch, watching football.  His team fumbles,
 and the opponents recover it for a touchdown.  Marge is upset that Homer
 wagered $50 on the game, but Homer insists it's not gambling.  The
 win is guaranteed.  (His team fumbles again, recovered for a touchdown.)

 In the car, Marge politely complains/scolds that she always has to drag
 everyone to church.  Homer tunes the football game on the car radio.
 When his team scores, he honks the horn and flashes his headlights.
 In the back seat, Bart also grins widely, listening to his Walkman.
   
   Announcer: This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose
              from the dead!
   Homer:     Laza-who?
   -- Driving to church, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 They arrive at the First Church of Springfield.  Bart dances silently
 to the music.
   
   Marge: [confiscates Bart's personal stereo]
          Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday School?
   Bart:  Maybe.
   Marge: Can you believe this, Homer? ... Homer?  Homer?
   Homer: [in the car, bashes his head on the steering wheel in frustration]
   Marge: [goes to the car]  Homer, were you planning on sitting in the
          car until the [football] game is over?
   Homer: Maybe.
   -- Great minds think alike, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 Marge tosses the radio into the car, and Homer pockets it.

 In Sunday School, Miss Allbright tries to explain to the kids that
 animals don't go to heaven.  Heaven is for people.
   
   Milhouse:  Will there be cavemen in heaven?
   Sunday School Teacher:  Certainly not!
   Bart: Uh, ma'am?  What if you're a really good person, but
         you get into a really, really bad fight and your leg gets
         gangrene and it has to be amputated.  Will it be waiting for
         you in heaven?
   Sunday School Teacher: For the last time, Bart, yes!
   -- Playing by the rules, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 Meanwhile, Reverend Lovejoy gives his sermon, titled, ``Gambling:  The
 Eighth Deadly Sin.''  Slowly push in on Homer in the congregation, wearing
 Bart's headphones and listening to the football game.  The audio changes
 to the play-by-play.  Reverend Lovejoy's arm motions serve to illustrate
 the football action.  Homer's team sets up for a game-winning field goal.
 Homer and the congregation pray.  The kick is good, and Homer stands up,
 yelling, ``It's good!  It's good!''  All eyes turn to him.  ``It's good...
 to see you all in church.''

 Meanwhile, Miss Allbright is completely exasperated.
   
   Sunday School Teacher:  [very tired]  The ventriloquist goes to heaven,
         but the dummy doesn't.
   Bart: [raises his hand]  Ooh-ooh-ooh!  Me!
   Sunday School Teacher:  Bart?
   Bart: What about a robot with a human brain?
   Sunday School Teacher:
         [at the breaking point] I don't know!  All these questions!
         Is a little blind faith too much to ask!?!
   -- ``The Telltale Head''
   
 The service has ended.  In the car, Marge scolds Homer, then...
   
   Marge: Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday School today?
   Lisa:  The answers to deep theological questions.
   Bart:  Yeah, among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
   Homer: What?  Those cute little monkeys?  That's terrible.
          Who told you that?
   Bart:  Our teacher.
   Homer: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but
          what about those really smart ones who live among us?
          Who roller-skate and smoke cigars?
   -- And work in nuclear power plants, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 The car stops for a traffic light in front of a movie theater.
   
   Bart:  Cool, man, Space Mutants 4.  Let me off!  Let me off!
   Marge: No way, Jose.
   Homer: Marge, they're only space mutants.
   Marge: Uh uh.  I know what those movies are like.
          Killing innocent people, eating human flesh.
          You'll just get a lot of bad ideas.
   -- ``The Telltale Head''
   
 At home, Bart approaches Homer, who is resting on the couch.  Bart asks
 for $5, and Homer winkingly hopes Bart doesn't spend it on a certain
 movie.  (``Perish the thought!'')  Bart goes upstairs, undresses in the
 hallway, enter his room
 naked, puts on his shirt and shorts, grabs his skateboard, and swings
 out the window, without once breaking stride.

 Bart skateboards cheerily to the theater, where he is greeted by Jimbo
 and Kerny, the worst kids in town.  Momentarily distracted, Bart
 crashes into a lamppost.  ``Didn't hurt.''  Dolph pops his head out
 the side door of the theater.  ``The coast is clear.''
   
   Bart:  You guys are sneaking in?
   Kerny: Yeah, only saps pay to see movies.
   Jimbo: Hey, Bart, come on!
   Bart:  But sneaking into movies is practically stealing, man.
   Kerny: Practically?
   Jimbo: It <is> stealing.
   Bart:  Well, okay.  I just wanted to make sure we aren't deluding ourselves.
   -- An irrefutable argument, ``The Telltale Head''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:04]

 The movie plays to a nearly empty theater.  The Space Mutant makes its
 surprise appearance.  At the same time, the usher grabs our
 quartet and tosses them out.  Says Dolph, ``We'll take our
 business elsewhere.''

 The quartet go into the Kwik-E-Mart, where Bart buys some Squishees with
 the $5 Homer gave him.  While Apu fills the order, the others shoplift
 like mad.  Bart pays for the drinks, and finds that the guys have left.
 He finds them in the parking lot, enjoying their booty.  They thank him
 for covering for them while they used the ``five finger discount''.

 They go into the town square, where Dolph, Kerny, and Jimbo throw rocks
 at the statue of Jebediah Springfield, town founder.  Jimbo hands Bart
 a rock, and he throws it.  A local shopkeeper chases them away.

 The gang lie on their backs, admiring the clouds.  Various shapes seen
 include a cherry bomb, a guy with a switchblade stuck in his back,
 a schoolbus going over a cliff with kids screaming, and a headless
 statue of Jebediah Springfield.  Jimbo, Kerny, and Dolph think it'd
 be cool if someone cut his head off.  When Bart leaps to Jebediah's
 defense, the other razz him.  ``Man, I thought you were cool.''  Bart
 trudges off.

 Bart pays another visit to the statue, and gets an idea.

 Back at home...

   Homer: I'm glad you asked, son.  Being popular is the most important thing
          in the world!
   Bart:  Like, sometimes, you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad,
          so other kids will like you better?

 At 3am, Bart, clad in black ninja garb, sneaks out of his room.  He
 accidentally steps on the cat, but grabs it and covers its mouth before
 it can scream out.  He release the cat outside and climbs out the window.
 Bart reaches the town square and unsheathes...  A hacksaw!  He climbs
 the statue and saws off the head.  We pull back from the town square
 as the sawing continues.  (*clunk*)  ``What have I done?''

 In bed, Bart wakes up and is startled by the head next to him.  Marge
 calls him down to breakfast, where Homer and Lisa enjoy their morning
 meal.

 Most of the bulbs have burnt out.  ``Nice try, Dad,'' says Lisa.
 Ned plugs in his Christmas lights, and his house lights up in electronic
 opulence, complete with a Santa on the roof that says, ``Ho ho ho.''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:24]

 At the breakfast table, Marge tells the kids to get their money to go
 Christmas shopping.  Homer asks Marge where she's been hiding the Christmas
 money, and Marge isn't telling.  While Homer's back is turned, she fishes
 a huge jar of cash out of her hair.

 At the mall, Bart spots ``The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor''...

   Oh, Bart, that's so sweet.  It's the best present a mother could get,
   and it makes you look so dangerous.
   -- Marge in Bart's dream of getting a tattoo,
      ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Bart heads inside.

   Bart:  One `mother' please.
   Clerk: Wait a minute.  How old are you?
   Bart:  Twenty-one, sir.
   Clerk: Get in the chair.
   -- Bart gets a tattoo, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Meanwhile, Homer checks the dials on a row of machines.  An announcement
 comes over the P.A. system.

   Smithers: Attention all personnel.  Please keep working during the
             following announcement.  And now, our boss and friend, Mr. Burns.
   Burns:    Hello.  I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase
             safety here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer
             or affecting management pay raises.  However, for you semi-skilled
             workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses.  Oh, and one more
             thing:  Merry Christmas!
   -- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Marge finds Bart getting a tattoo and yanks him out of the shop.  Bart's
 incomplete tattoo reads, ``Moth.''  The doctor says that he can remove the
 tattoo with lasers, but he insists on a cash payment up front.  Marge
 notes, ``Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.''  The laser does its work.

 At home, Bart's arm is bandaged.

   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Lisa:   [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Maggie: [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   Homer:  [comes in]  Hey, what's with this?  [touches Bart's injured arm]
   Bart:   Ow!  Quit it.
   -- If I've told you once... `Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer learns that Marge had to spend the Christmas money on getting the
 tattoo removed.  Homer cancels Christmas, but Marge says, ``We'll just
 have to stretch your Christmas bonus a little further this year.''
 Homer pretends he still has one then steps outside.  He watches
 Ned's extravagant Christmas lights and hangs his head.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 8:58]

   Marge: [in bed, reading the shopping list]
          I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer.
   Homer: Huh?  Oh, I love you Marge.
   Marge: Homer, you tell me that all the time.
   Homer: Oh good, because I <do> love you.
          I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit
          card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
   Marge: Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.
          I keep asking for it, but...
   Homer: Marge...  Oh... Let me be honest with you...
   Marge: Yes?
   Homer: Well... I...
   Marge: [rubs his hand]
   Homer: I want to do the Christmas shopping this year!
   Marge: [hands over the list she was holding]  Well, sure.  Okay.
          [flicks bed-side light off. Homer's forced grin glows in the dark]
   -- Homer can't bear to tell Marge that his Christmas bonus has been cancelled,
      ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer pays a visit to the Circus of Values (nothing over $4.99).
 He buys a six-pack of panty hose for Marge, pads of paper for Bart,
 and a squeak toy pork chop for Maggie.  (``It says it's for dogs, but
 she can't read.'')  On his way out, he bumps into Ned, laden with gifts.
 Their respective armfuls of goodies fall into the snow.

   Homer: [bumps into Ned.  Their respective armfuls of gifts fall into the snow]
   Ned:   Oh ho ho, Simpson, it's you.
   Homer: Hello, Flanders.
   Ned:   Oh my, what a little mess we've got here.  Well, which ones are yours
          and which ones are mine?
   Homer: Well, let's see.
   Ned:   [picking up gifts] Well, this one's mine, and this one's mine, heh heh,
          this one's mine, and...
   Homer: They're <all> yours!

 All except the squeeze toy for Maggie.  (Squink, squink.)

 Homer is drinking at Moe's, and Barney comes in dressed as Santa.

   Barney: I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall.
   Homer:  Wow.  Can <I> do that?
   Barney: I dunno.  They're pretty selective.  [belch]
   -- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer applies.

   Manager: Do you like children?

 Homer attends Santa school.  They practice saying, ``Ho ho ho.''  Homer
 is asked to name Santa's reindeer...

   Dasher...  Dancer...  Prancer...  Nixon...
   -- Homer lists Santa's reindeer, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer practices talking to a boy on his lap.

 Homer returns home and greets Patty and Selma.  They are their usual
 non-cheery selves.  They note that there isn't a Christmas tree, andHomer
 says he was on his way out to get one.  He drives past signs that read
 ``All trees $75'', ``$60 and up'', ``Christmas trees, slightly irregular,
 $45'', heading instead for a sign that says, ``No trespassing.''  He
 chainsaws a tree and carries it to the car one step ahead of the guard
 dogs and gunfire.

 The kids are impressed.  Selma inquires after the birdhouse in the tree.
 ``Do I smell gunpowder?''

 At the mall, Homer plays Santa to a young boy and tells the child that
 he should be happy he has a good home and a loving father.  Homer steals
 a bite of the kid's donut.  Lewis, Bart, and Milhouse watch the pathetic
 Santa down below.  Milhouse dares Bart to yank his beard off.  Bart accepts
 the challenge.

   Bart:  Hey Santa, what's shakin', man?
   Homer: [as Santa]  What's your name, Bart...ner?  Uh, little partner?
   Bart:  I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?
   -- Homer works as a department store Santa,
      ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Bart yanks off Homer's beard, and Homer takes Bart aside.  He explains
 that he didn't get a bonus, but he'd do anything to keep the family from
 missing out on Christmas.

   You must really love us to sink so low.
   -- Bart admires Homer's working as a department store Santa,
      ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer returns to work.

 Homer reaches the head of the paycheck line, to find that he's earned
 only $13.

   Homer: Thirteen bucks?  Hey, wait a minute.
   Clerk: That's right.  $120 gross, less Social Security...
   Homer: Yeah.

   -- Paydirt, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Barney is on his way to Springfield Downs.  He's got a hot tip on a dog
 in the fourth race.  Whirlwind, a 12--1 shot.  Homer isn't so sure.

   Bart:  Aw come on, Dad.  This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons'
          Christmas.  If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always
          happen to poor kids at Christmas.  It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened
          to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's going to happen
          to us!
   Homer: Well, okay, let's go.  Who's Tiny Tim?

 [more audio dropout.  I really gotta get cable...]
 Lisa watches `The Happy Little Elves'.

 Homer, Bart, and Barney arrive at Springfield Downs.  In the fourth race,
 there's been a scratch.  The replacement is a dog named Santa's Little
 Helper.  Homer figures, with a name like that, it can't lose.  The odds
 are 99--1.  Bart isn't so sure that this is a great idea, but he
 reluctantly lends his support.

 Back at home, the Happy Little Elves are happy again, and Lisa is pleased.
 Patty bad-mouths Homer.

   Lisa:  What, Aunt Patty?
   Patty: Oh, nothing, dear.  I'm just trashing your father.
   Lisa:  Well, I wish you wouldn't because, aside from the fact that he has the
          same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have.
          Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will
          govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
          So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me,
          and I am far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
   Patty: Mm hm.  Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
   -- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 The race is run, and SLH is dead last.  Way, way behind the rest of the pack.

   Don't worry, Dad.  Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
   -- Bart's been watching too much TV, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Whirlwind wins.  SLH doesn't even make it to the finish line.

   It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
   -- Bart, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Outside, Homer and Bart go through the discarded tickets in search of
 a winner.  Barney skids past, brandishing his winnings (and Daria).
 SLH's owner tells the dog to scram, and SLH leaps into Homer's arms.

   Bart:  Oh, Dad, can we keep him?
   Homer: But he's a loser!  He's pathetic!  He's...
   SLH:   [licks Homer's face]
   Homer: ... a Simpson.
   -- ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire''

 Homer finally arrives home, and admits that he didn't get a bonus at all.
 Bart shows the family SLH, and Lisa is ecstatic.  ``So love at first
 sight <is> possible!''  Adds Bart, ``And if he runs away, he'll be easy
 to catch!''  Marge says it's the best gift of all, something to share
 their love, and frighten prowlers.  The tender moment is captured forever
 in a snapshot.

--Episode: Bart the genius
 Maggie places an `E' block atop a teetering pile.  She admires her work,
 then in a flurry of arms, knocks them all down.  A Scrabble (tm) tile
 falls to the floor, and Lisa picks it up.  Pull back to reveal that the
 rest of the family are playing the classic word game.  Bart waits
 impatiently for Marge to make her move, and she does:  She places an `H'
 on the board to spell `HE'.  Now it's Homer's turn.  He grumbles, ``How
 can anyone make a word out of these lousy letters!''  Homer's rack contains
 the letters O-X-I-D-I-Z-E.  He decides to play the `D' to spell `DO'.
 Lisa places an `I' above the `D'...
   
   Lisa:  `Id', triple-word score!
   Homer: No abbreviations.
   Lisa;  Not I.D., Dad, `id'.  It's a word!
   Bart:  As in ``This game is stoop-id''.
   -- Playing Scrabble (tm), ``Bart the Genius''
   
 Lisa reminds Bart that he's supposed to be building his vocabulary for
 tomorrow's aptitude test.  Marge suggests they check the dictionary, and
 Homer is surprised that they have one.  It's currently being used to
 prop up the couch.  Lisa looks up the word and confirms her score.
 Now it's Bart's turn.
   
   Bart:  Here we go.  Kwyjibo.   [places his tiles] K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.
          Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points
          for using all my letters.  Game's over.  I'm outta here. [gets up]

          Wait a minute, you little cheater!
          You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.
   Bart:  Kwyjibo.  Uh... a big, dumb, balding North American ape.  With no chin.
   Marge: And a short temper.

 Springfield Elementary School, before the morning bell.  Kids on the
 playground, doing standard things.  Playing marbles.  Skipping rope.
 Playing some combination of kickball and dodgeball.  Spraying graffiti.
 Spraying graffiti?  Oh, it's Bart, completing a ``I am a weiner [sic]''
 of Principal Skinner.

 Martin squeals on Bart.  Milhouse warns Bart, who quickly discards his
 can of spraypaint.
   
   Pr.Sk:  Whoever did this is in very deep trouble.
   Martin: And a sloppy speller, too.
           The preferred spelling of `weiner' is W-<I>-<E>-N-E-R,
           although E-I is an acceptable ethnic variant.
   Pr.Sk:  Good point.
   -- Either way, he's still a weiner.  ``Bart the Genius''
   
 Skinner orders the kids to show their hands, and Bart is literally caught
 red-handed.  Skinner schedules a chat with Bart.  The usual time and place.
 (Skinner's office, after school.)

 The bell rings, and the kids file in.  Martin asks Bart not to hold a
 grudge; he was merely protecting school property.  Bart responds, ``Eat
 my shorts.''  Ms. Krabappel hands out the IQ tests.
   
   Now I don't want you to worry, class.  These test will have no effect on your
   grade.  They merely determine your future social status and financial success.

   Ms.K: Shhh!  [points to her head]  Visualize it, Bart!
   Bart: [visualizing in black-and-white]  At the same time, the local train
         travelling 30 miles an hour and carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix
         bound for Santa Fe.  It is eight cars long and always carries the
         same number of passengers in each car.  [Bart counts five passengers on
         the train car (the number hovering over each passenger's head)
         and visualizes 40 / 8 = 5.  The train travels through a numerical
         landscape.]
         An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of
         minutes past the hour get off, and three times as many plus six
         get on.  [Bart and his equation are trampled by the passengers.]
         At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice
         as many get on as got on at the first stop.  [Trampled again.
         Bart spits out a number.]
   Train conductor:  Ticket, please.
   Bart: I don't have a ticket!
   Train conductor:  Come with me, boy.

   -- Math is Hell, ``Bart the Genius''
   
 The two trains crash into each other, throwing Bart into the air...

 ... and onto his back on the classroom floor.  Ms. Krabappel tells Bart
 to stop distracting the others, but Martin isn't distracted.  In fact,
 he's finished.  Ms. Krabappel lets Martin go outside and read under a
 tree.

 Bart returns to his seat and exchanges faces with Martin through the
 window.
   
   What are you looking at, Bart!  Are those naughty dogs back again?
   -- Ms. Krabappel catches Bart staring out the window, ``Bart the Genius''
   
 While Ms. Krabappel looks outside, Bart grabs Martin's test, changes
 the name to `Bart Simpson' and replaces it.  He then writes `Martin
 Prince' on his own sheet and fills in the dots randomly.

 Marge and Homer walk through the schoolyard.  Marge maintains that Bart
 is merely a sheep that has strayed from the fold and needs to be hugged
 extra hard.  Homer answers, ``That's exactly the kind of crapola that's
 lousing him up!''  Homer is impressed by Bart's graffito.

 Marge and Homer reach the principal's office.
   
   Pr.Sk: I caught your son defacing school property this morning.
          We estimate the damage is $75, and frankly, we think it's terribly
          unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
   Homer: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you going to do?
   Marge: [whispers to Homer]
   Homer: Oh no.  He can't mean that.  [to Principal Skinner]
          My wife thinks you want <me> to pay for it.
   Pr.Sk: That <was> the idea.
   Homer: Oh.
   -- ``Bart the Genius''
   
 While Homer writes out a check, Principal Skinner shows them a
 sloppily-scrawled absence note which reads ``Please excuse Bart.
 He was sick.  Homer Simpson.''  But he changes his assessment of
 the note as a forgery when he sees Homer's handwriting on the check...

 In comes Dr. J. Loren Pryor, district psychiatrist...
   
   What do <we> need a psychiatrist for?  We know our kid is nuts.
   -- Homer, ``Bart the Genius''
   
 Dr. Pryor informs all that Bart is, believe it or not, a genius.
   
   Dr.J:  The child is not supposed to know his own IQ, of course, but
          as you can see, it's beyond the range of any doubt.

         intellectual development on an independent basis?
   Bart: Oh, like you're reading my mind, man.
   -- Great minds think alike, ``Bart the Genius''
   
 Dr. Pryor explains that when a genius is forced to slow down to that of
 a `normal' person, he tends to lash out (indicates Bart's disciplinary
 folder).
   
   Pr.Sk: I think we should re-test him.
   Dr.J:  No, I think we should move him to another school.
   Pr.Sk: Even better!
   -- Bart is identified as a genius, ``Bart the Genius''
   
 Dr. Pryor suggests that Bart enroll in a school for the gifted, where there
 are no rules, no homework, nothing to stifle intellectual creativity.
 Bart's eyes open wide and he eagerly accepts.
   
   Homer: My son, a genius!?  How does it happen?
   Dr.J:  Well, genius, like intelligence, is usually the result of heredity
          and environment.

 At the breakfast table, Bart squirms as Marge combs down his hair.  Once
 she's gone, he musses it back up.  Homer suggests Bart wear a tie (since
 all boy geniuses wear ties), but Bart refuses to let it stifle his
 creativity.
   
   Marge: It's a big day for you.  Why don't you eat something a little more
          nutritious.
   Homer: Nonsense, Marge.  Frosty Krusty Flakes is what got him where he

 Lisa tells Bart, despite the testing, she still insists he's a dimwit.
 Bart replies, ``<This> dimwit is on easy street.''

 On the drive to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart
 tells Homer to take the scenic route.  They finally arrive, and Bart
 discovers that all the boys are wearing neckties.
   
   Bart:  Oh no, ties!
   Homer: Don't worry, son, you can have mine.
          Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.

 Homer shoves Bart into the classroom, where Ms. Mellon [pron. /mel-LON/]
 introduces him around.  They have only one rule:  Make your own rules.
 ``If you feel sleepy, take a nap.  If you get bored, feel free to take
 out a book and start reading.''  Bart sifts through the shelf and discovers
 a Radioactive Man comic.  Ms. Mellon tosses it into the trash, but Bart
 fishes it back out.

 Bart is introduced to his classmates.  Ethan speaks in palindromes.
 (``O Memsahib, Bart.  Rabbi has memo.'')  Sidney speaks in backwards
 phonetics.  (``Trabing norm doog!'')  Bart reacts appropriately.
 Cecile is performing a virus experiment on hamsters.
 (``I wouldn't get too attached, Bart.  We're dissecting him next week.'')

 Class begins.  Ms. Mellon invites everyone to greet Bart (and they do,
 in assorted foreign languages).  They continue yesterday's discussion on
 the existence of free will, and Ian's contribution sparks Ms. Mellon to
 ask the class for examples of paradoxes.  Hands go up, save one.
   
   Ms.M: Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?

 with a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Marge and Lisa pop by.

           Hey!  What's the problem here?
   Lisa:   We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
   Homer:  [touched]  You were?  [sniff]  Aww... Well, go ahead.
           [releases the kids]
   Bart:   You love him more.|      |No I don't!|             |<No I don't!>
   Lisa:                  |No, <you> do!|       |Yes you <do>!|
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer threatens the kids to get it out of their system.  ``I don't want
 you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.''  Homer enters the kitchen and
 inspects a hugenormous mixture of green jelly and marshmallows.
   
   Mmmmm.... marshmallows...
   -- Homer admires Marge's gelatinous dessert, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 After helping himself (and belching), he earns a scolding from Marge.
   
   Homer:  Are you sure that's enough?
           You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts!
   Marge:  Oh Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it... [indicates with her
           finger]  Once.
   Homer:  Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoke to me without using the
           word...  [dejectedly]  Bonehead.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone is in the car with a plate of delicious gelatin dessert on their
 laps.

 On arrival, the family (save Marge) carry the plates above their heads.
 Homer sets some ground rules with the kids.
   
   Homer:  Okay, now look.  My boss is going to be at this picnic, so I want
           you to show your father some love and/or respect.
   Lisa:   Tough choice.
   Bart:   I'm picking respect.

 Mr. Burns welcomes the Gammel family.  When Gammel Jr.\ complains about
 missing little league, the father kindly tells his son to be quiet.
   
   Burns:    Oh please please, don't fight.  Just go out back and have a good
             time.  [to Smithers]  Fire that man Smithers, I don't want him, or
             his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.
   Smithers: He'll be gone by the tug-of-war sir.
   Burns:    Excellent.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The Simpsons arrive.
   
   Homer:    Ah, afternoon Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    Hello there... uh... uh...
   Homer:    [whispers to Smithers]  Simpson, Homer.
   Smithers: [hands an index card to Burns]  Here you go, sir.
   Burns:    Ah!  Oh yes... [reads the card]  Oh, and this must be your lovely
             wife... Marge.
   Marge:    [smiles]
   Burns:    Ho ho, look at little... uh... [consults the card]  Lisa!  Why,
             she's growing like a weed.
             And this must be... uh, Brat!
   Brat:     [unimpressed]  Bart.
   Homer:    Don't correct the man, Brat!

 Homer presents their delicious gelatin dessert.
   
   Oh, for the love of Peter!
   -- Monty Burns utters a frustrated expletive, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 It seems that ``some damned fool went around telling everyone that I loved
 that slimy goop!''  He instructs them to ``toss it on the pile over there,''
 indicating several rooms already filled with gelatinous dessert.
   
   Burns:  Make yourselves at home.
   Bart:   Hear that Dad?  You can lie around in your underwear and scratch
           yourself.
   Homer:  [angrily, he goes to strangle Bart]  Now you listen to me!
   Burns:  Trouble, Simpson?
   Homer:  [one hand around Bart's neck]  No, heh heh heh.  Just congratulating
           the son on a fine joke about his old man.  [nervously pats Bart's
           head]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Out the back of the estate, Homer stresses the importance of proper conduct
 with Bart and Lisa.
   
   Homer:  Now, remember!  As far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.
   Lisa:   Hey Bart!  Last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!
   Homer:  D'oh!  [chasing after the two]  Be normal!  Be normal!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 One of the other mothers recommends that they dump their adorable girls in
 the nursery and get a glass of punch, but Marge admits to not being much of
 drinker.  ``Is that your boy there torturing a swan?''  Marge suggests
 a glass of punch.  Homer is still chasing after Bart and Lisa (who
 is hiding in the fountain).  The two mothers enter a room where a group of
 small children are playing.
   
   Marge:   Do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
   Mother:  You're right.  [turns on the TV]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Outside, Homer continues his search for Bart and Lisa.  Lisa has disguised
 herself as a fountain cherub.
   
   Homer:  Bart!  Lisa!  [swans stampede Homer]  Willya... D'oh...  Where are are
           you kids!  [Bart beans Homer with a rock]  Ow!
   Bart:   Oops.  [Homer grabs Bart]  Whoa, careful Dad.  Blow a gasket, and
           you lose you job.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   
   NOW HEAR THIS, THE FATHER-SON SACK RACE WILL BEGIN IN FIVE MINUTES
   ON THE NORTH LAWN.  PARTICIPATION IS MANDATORY, REPEAT MANDATORY.
   THAT IS ALL.
   -- Picnic announcement, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Homer:  You remember the rules from last year?
   Bart:   Yeah, shut my mouth and let your boss win.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer drags Bart along to the event.  One of the swans has its revenge on
 Bart's behind.  The employees' wives are gathered around a bowl of punch.
   
   Mother:  I don't know who to love more...  My son Joshua who's
            captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber who got the lead
            in the school play.  Usually, I use their grades as a tie-breaker,
            but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
   Marge:   [helping herself to ample amounts of the punch]  Umm-hmm.  Well I
            sense greatness in my family.
   Mother:  <Your> family?
   Marge:   Well, it's a greatness that others can't see... but it's there, and
            if it's not <true> greatness we have, we're at <least> average.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   I don't want to alarm anyone, [woozily]  but I think there's a
   little al-key-hol in this punch.  [scoops another cupful]
   -- Marge enjoys some liquid refreshment at the company picnic,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The Father-Son sack race is ready to be run.
   
   Smithers: Mr. Burns, are you ready?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: Are you set?
   Burns:    Yes.
   Smithers: [whispers]  Go, Mr. Burns!
   Burns:    [feebly hops away]
   Smithers: [after Burns gets a healthy lead, fires the starter's pistol]
             (*bang*)
   -- The Father-Son sack race at the company picnic,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone cautiously stays a few leaps behind the man who can fire them.
 Bart grouses, ``Man, this is pathetic!  I'm going for it!''  Bart takes
 the lead, and Homer does a flying tackle to stop Bart just short of
 the finishing line.  Burns feebly hops to victory.  ``Close one this year.''

 Marge is at this point completely sloshed and leads the other mothers
 in a song.
   
   Marge:  Here we sit, enjoying the shade.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  Drink the drink that I have made.
   Wives:  Hey, Marge, and pour the wine!
   Marge:  He's here with me, my one and only.
   Homer:  [runs past chasing the kids, sees Marge]  Huh?
   Marge:  Drink, my friends and don't be lonely.
   Homer:  [slaps his forehead] Oh!
   Wives:  Hey Marge, and pour the wine!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer goes to retrieve his wife.
   
   Homer:  Snap out of it Marge!  You've gotta come with me, the boss is going
           to make a toast.
   Marge:  Whoa, oh, I'm not much of a drinker.  [collapses]
   Homer:  You picked a perfect time to start, you... [Marge gazes at him]
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Late afternoon, and everyone is gathered around the rotunda.  A marching band
 plays ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow''.
   
   Burns:    Musicians, cease that infernal tootling! [they do]
   Smithers: [hands Burns a card]
   Burns:    Thank you all.
   Smithers: [hands another card]
   Burns:    Ah... For coming.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 The crowd applauds.  Marge keeps clapping, then apologizes to everyone
 (individually).
   
   Now it's time to say goodbye.
   Please get off my property until next year.
   I suggest you don't dawdle, the hounds will be released in ten minutes.
   -- Burns closes the company picnic, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 As the families leave, a son thanks his father for the good time he's had.
 Mr. Burns likes to see this kind of family unity and promotes the father.
   
   Homer:  Quick Bart, give me a kiss.
   Bart:   Kiss you?  But Dad, I'm your kid!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer pays Bart five dollars.  Bart takes the money and uncomfortably
 kisses his father.
   
   Burns:    Ugh, I've never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
   Smithers: Fabulous observation sir, just fabulous.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Everyone walks back to their cars (except for Marge, who is flying Cloud-9)
 Homer congratulates the other father for his success with ``that corn-ball
 routine.''  Homer watches the other man's son politely opens the door for
 his sister, while Bart and Lisa fight to be the first in the car.
 As the `good' wife offers to drive her tired husband home, Marge thinks
 she's going to be sick.

 The other family (complete with halos and angelic wings) drive off,
 singing, ``There was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o...''
 He looks back at the demons that possess his family, with their sharp teeth
 and nails, elfin ears and fiery hair.  The surrounding country-side takes on
 a hellish glow.
   
   Marge:  Homey!  Get in the car!
   Lisa:   This is where you belong!
   Bart:   Yeah Homer, room for one more!
   Marge+Lisa+Bart: [chanting]  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They cackle sinisterly as Homer steps into the car and drives off into a
 landscape covered in lava and burning sulphur.  The blessed family ride home
 on their ``Roadway to Heaven''.  Homer sighs as the camera pulls back to
 show the interior of the car (everyone is back to normal), with Marge looking
 very sour.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:06]

 Dinnertime at the Simpsons.  Marge and the kids shovel food into their
 mouths while staring at the TV.  ``Unable to fend for themselves, the baby
 bald eaglets are dependent on their mother regurgitating the food.''
 This doesn't affect Bart and Lisa's appetites at all.  Homer enters,
 turns off the TV set, and insists, ``We're not going to shovel food into
 our mouths while we stare at the TV.  We're going to eat at the dining
 room table like a normal family.''

 The family are seated in the dining room.  Lisa asks, ``Happy, Dad?''
 Homer answers, ``Yes.''  Lisa concludes, ``Good, commence shoveling.''

 Homer stops everyone in mid-shovel and insists they say Grace.
   
   Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.
   -- Bart says Grace, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer stops him. ``Ignore the boy, Lord.''
   
   Homer:  Dear Lord, thank You for this microwave bounty, even though we
           don't deserve it.  I mean... our kids are uncontrollable hellions!
           Pardon my French... but they act like savages! [kids bewildered]
           Did You see them at the picnic?  Oh, of course You did... You're
           everywhere, You're omnivorous.
           Oh Lord!  Why did You spite me with this family?
   Marge and the kids:  Amen!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 With a shout of ``Let's eat!'' Bart and the family recommence shoveling.
   
   Homer:  Sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
   Marge:  Maybe we should move to a larger community.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   D'oh!
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Don't have a cow, Dad.
   -- Bart, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   The sad truth is, all families are like us.
   -- Lisa, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer begs to differ.  ``Well there's only one way to find out.''  He
 takes the family on a little excursion.

 The family crawl up to a neighbor's window and inside see a standard
 1950's television family having a banquet.
   
   Homer:  Look at that, kids!  No fighting, no yelling.
   Bart:   No belching.
   Lisa:   Their dad has a shirt on!
   Marge:  Look!  Napkins!
   Bart:   These people are obviously freaks.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer takes them to ``see what's behind door number two.''  The family
 see a family having a conversation.  ``They actually enjoy talking to
 each other,'' observes Marge.  The conversation?  The child says,
 ``I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.''  The father answers,
 ``I did too.  Better get the gun.''  The father appears at the front
 door with a shotgun.

 The Simpsons make their escape, then approach another window.
   
   Bart:   Whoa!  Look at this place, what a dump!
   Homer:  It's worst than you think, heh heh heh.  I just trampled this poor
           sap's flower bed.
   Marge:  Ho-mer, this is <our> house.
   -- Homer takes the family to see what `normal' families are like,

 Homer lingers outside.
   
   I want to be alone with my thought.
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 At Moe's tavern, Homer has no interest in the boxing match.
 The two cops walk in.
   
   Moe:    Eddie!  Would you like some pretzels?
   Eddie:  No thanks, we're on duty.  A couple of beers would be nice though.
   -- The two cops pay a visit to Moe's Tavern, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They're investigating a family of peeping toms who have been terrorizing
 the neighborhood.  The police dog finds Homer and goes nuts, and the cops
 must remove the dog forcibly from the premises.
   
   You know Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.
   She said, ``Homer, you're a big disappointment'', and God bless her
   soul, she was really onto something.
   -- Homer, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Barney: Don't blame yourself Homer.  You've got yourself a bad hand.  You've
           got crummy little kids that nobody can control.
   Homer:  You can't talk way about my kids!  Or at least two of them.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Barney asks, ``You got two that I haven't met?''\ and earns a fistful
 from Homer.  As the boxing match continues, Homer and Barney struggle
 on their own.  Barney floors Homer.  A commercial comes on, and Homer
 watches from floor-level.

 Marge is with the kids watching an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.  Homer enters.
   
   Homer:  All right, time for a family meeting.  [shuts off the TV]
   Lisa:   Why can't we have a meeting when <you're> watching TV?
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Homer:  Now look... You know and I know this family needs help, professional
           help.  So I've made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.
   Bart:   The fat guy on TV?
   Lisa:   You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro-wrestling?
   Homer:  Boxing, Lisa, boxing.  There's a world of difference.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Marge is worried if this is this the right thing to do.
   
   Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study, and of all the commercials
   I saw, his was the best.
   -- Homer suggests the family see Dr. Marvin Monroe,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 And it costs only $250.  Marge tells him they don't have that kind of money.
 Homer commands her to bring out the kids' college fund.
   
   Oh come on Marge... Why skimp now on the off-chance that they'll
   actually get in someplace.
   -- Homer asks Marge to fetch the children's college fund,
      ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Marge counts the contents of a smashed piggy-bank on the kitchen table.
 Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.  Homer's not licked yet.
   
   Homer:  To save this family we're gonna have to make the <supreme> sacrifice.
   Lisa:   No Dad!  Please don't pawn the TV!
   Bart:   Aw come on, Dad, anything but that!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Marge:  Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?
   Homer:  I appreciate that, honey,
           but we need one hundred an fifty dollars here!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They enter the pawn shop.  The clerk welcomes the family (by name).
   
   Homer:  [presenting TV]  Would you pay $150 for this <lovely> Motorola?
   Clerk:  Is it cable-ready?
   Homer:  As ready as she'll ever be.
   -- Pawn shop, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 They have a deal.  At Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center, the family signs
 for their appointment with the receptionist.  ``My Love Is Blue'' plays in
 the background.
   
   Marge:  [despairingly] Homer, you raided the college fund, the TV... Homer,
           you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.
   Homer:  Hey!  No pain, no gain!
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
   Receptionist:  Will you be paying by cash or check?
   Homer:  Cash of course!  I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here
           with me.  I'm holding it right now.  Here it is, look... check it
           out.  [Homer realizes he could be making a big mistake.]  Two hundred
           and fifty big ones.
   Bart:   You really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where
           our TV used to be.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 A family who resemble the Simpsons have concluded their therapy session, and
 go to express their new found ability to express love for each other with a
 round of frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Homer makes his decision, and hands
 the money over to the receptionist.  ``There go my young girl dreams of
 Vassar,'' muses Lisa.

 Dr. Marvin Monroe welcomes the Simpsons into his office.
   
   Monroe: Hello, I'm Doctor Marvin Monroe, no doubt you recognize me from TV.
   Lisa:   We would if we had one.
   -- ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer shouts at Lisa, but Marvin Monroe tells Homer he mustn't stifle the
 youngster, that his family must be free to express itself.  Dr. Monroe
 hands them pads and jumbo markers to draw their fears, their anxieties,
 the roots of their unhappiness.  They take a deep cleansing breath, and
 begin.

 Bart shows a drawing of Homer.  Lisa, the same.  Marge likewise.  [Monroe:
 ``No surprises there.'']  Homer continues drawing, not paying attention to
 Dr. Monroe.  He draws a plane dropping a load of bombs.  Doctor Marvin
 Monroe concludes that the family views Homer as ``an ogre, if you will.''
 Bart's chimes his agreement, and Homer reaches for a lamp.  Doctor
 Monroe quickly takes possession of the lamp.
   
   Whoa!  Okay, so you want to kill each other.  That's good, that's
   healthy.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict.
   -- Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 He asks merely that they use his patented aggression therapy mallets,
 unlocking them from a gun-rack.  Said mallets consists of a steel rod
 padded with foam rubber.  After another deep cleansing breath, the
 Simpsons take it out on each other.
   
   Homer:  Wait a minute, these mallet things are padded with foam rubber.
           What's the point?
   Bart:   They work much better without the padding, Doc.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Over Marvin Monroe's protestations, Bart demonstrates his point by
 thwacking the doctor's shin.  Dr. Monroe angrily takes the steel rod
 from Bart and concludes that portion of the treatment.  Asks Marge,
 ``Are we cured yet?''  Monroe answers, ``No!  Don't be ridiculous.''
 He requires somewhat more unorthodox methods.  ``I'll have plenty of
 time to explain while I warm up the...  Electric generator.''

 In another room, the family sit with metal straps attached to their head and
 arms, and a console with four button in front of each of them.
   
   Monroe: Everyone comfy?  Hmmph, good.  Now don't touch any of those buttons
           in front of you for a very important reason.  I.e., You are wired in
           to the rest of your family.  You have the ability to shock them, and
           they have the ability to shock---(*buzzzzzz*)
   Homer:  Waaaaaaugh!
   Bart:   Just testing.
   -- At Doctor Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy, ``There's No Disgrace Like Home''
   
 Homer is about to press a button, but Monroe holds his arm back.
   
   Monroe: This is what's known as aversion therapy.  When someone hurts you
           emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will
           learn not to hurt each other at all!  And won't that be wonderful
           Homer?
   Homer:  Oh yes, doctor!  [zaps Bart]
   Bart:   Oh!  [presses button]
   Lisa:   Owwww!
   Marge:  [scornfully]  Bart!  How could you shock you little sister?
   Bart:   My finger slipped.  [zapped]  Whaaaaagh!
   Lisa:   So did mine!  [zapped by Bart]  Aigh!  [she retaliates]
   Bart:   Arggh!  [zaps Lisa again]

--Episode: Bart the general 
 Interior of the oven, cupcakes baking.  Homer opens the door, and Marge
 explains that Lisa's baking them for her teacher.  Door closes.  Bart
 opens the door and reaches in, but Marge yanks him away.  Lisa
 ices the most recent batch of chocolate cupcakes...
   
   Bart:  You know, there are names for people like you.
   Lisa:  No there aren't.
   Bart:  Teacher's pet!  Apple polisher!  Butt-kisser!
   Homer: Bart, you're saying butt-kisser like it's a bad thing!
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Homer tells Bart it never hurts to grease the wheel, but Lisa denies that
 she's doing it for the grades.  She gets good grades because she pays
 attention and studies hard.  Homer grabs a cupcake, and the kids dash off
 when the school bus horn honks.  Lisa nips back in time to grab the
 cupcake before Homer can eat it.  (``D'oh!'')

 Bart complains to Otto that Lisa baked a batch of cupcakes for her teacher
 and isn't letting him have even a single crumb.  Lisa hands over a cupcake.
 ``Here, Otto.  I made an extra one for you.''

 Bart takes the seat next to Lisa, and when the bus sets into motion, the
 box jostles, and Bart helps catch it.  Lisa grabs the box back.
   
   Bart: You sniveling toad!  You little egg-sucker!
   Lisa: [holding secure her box of cupcakes] Tell me more!
   Bart; Back-scratcher!  Boot-licker!  Honor student!
   Lisa: [smirking]  You'll never get one now, name-caller.
   Bart: All right, all right.  Look, I'm sorry.  I, I got upset.
         In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
   Lisa: [milking it] You weren't thinking, were you.
   Bart: No.
   Lisa: I'm <not> a sniveling toad, am I?
   Bart: Not really.
   Lisa: I'm <not> a little egg-sucker, am I?
   Bart: Of course not.
   Lisa: Then what am I?
   Bart: A beautiful human being.
   Lisa: [coyly]  What do you like best about me?
   Bart: [staring at the cupcakes] Well, I'd have to say...
         Your generous nature, your spirit of giving.
   Lisa: Well... [thinks]  Open your mouth and close your eyes, and you will
         get a big surprise.
   Bart: [does so]
   Lisa: [gets up.  The bus stops, and a cupcake falls out of the box.
         Lisa picks it up and shoves it into Bart's mouth, then leaves]
   Bart: [munching]  Thanks, Lis.  You're the best!
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Once off the bus, a bully grabs the cupcakes and goes through the box,
 taking one bite out of each before discarding it.  Bart threatens the
 boy, but Lisa warns Bart that the kid is a friend of Nelson Muntz.
 The boy pretends to hand over the box, but drops it and stomps on it.
 This proves too much for Bart, who leaps to attack the kid.  A scuffle
 ensues (with the other kids cheering), and a hand reaches in and grabs
 Bart.  It's Nelson, who holds Bart harmlessly at arm's length, then
 tosses him aside.  Nelson is bleeding.  He explains that he always
 gets other people's blood on his face.  But this time, it really <is>
 his blood.
   
   It was an accident, man.  A terrible, ghastly mistake.
   -- Bart tries to talk his way out of another jam, ``Bart the General''
   
 A cold wind blows.  Skinner stops by.  ``Play friendly, children.''
 The bell rings.
   
   Nelson: [threateningly] I'll get you after school, man.
   Bart:   But...
   Princ. Skinner: Oh no no no, he'll get you after school, son.
           Now hurry up, it's time for class.
   Bart:   But...
   Princ. Skinner: [shooing]  Scoot, young Simpson!  There's learning to be done!
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 During class, Bart daydreams...  Nelson is now a giant, who chases Bart
 down the hallway.  Bart throws knives at him, which he merely pushes
 away after they embed in his chest.  Bullets from a machine gun merely
 bounce off him.  Bart is trapped, and giant-Nelson grabs Bart and says,
 ``Lunchtime!''  Bart falls down Nelson's throat...

 ``Lunchtime, Bart,'' says Milhouse.  Milhouse tells Bart he has to
 tell Skinner, but Bart refuses to violate the code of the schoolyard.

 They reach the lunchroom, where Lisa introduces ``Bart the bully-killer!''
   
   Look, everybody.  I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this.
   I'm not saying that I'm not a hero.
   I'm just saying that... I fear for my safety.
   -- Bart, ``Bart the General''
   
 Nelson and his two cronies push through the crowd.  The other kids scoot.
 Nelson tells Bart to be at the flagpole at 3:15.  And not to be late.
 He has four other meetings that afternoon.

 Bart daydreams in class again...   It's his funeral.  Open casket.  (Bart
 has his lunchbox tucked under his arm.)
   
   Otto: [at Bart's wake]  Good-bye, little dude.
         [to Principal Skinner]  He looks so lifelike, man!
   Principal Skinner: Yes, the nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his
         little face after the fight.  Good-bye, son.  I guess you were right.
         All that homework <was> a waste of your time.
   -- Wake me when it's over, ``Bart the General''
   
   Thanks, Bart!  We got the day off from school for this!
   -- Milhouse attends Bart's wake, ``Bart the General''
   
 Homer gleefully says he got the day off from work for this.  Marge jabs
 him in the ribs, and Homer acts in a manner more befitting the situation.
 Marge and Maggie bid Bart farewell.  Lisa holds a cupcake.  ``I can't
 help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place,
 this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided.''  She leaves it
 on his forehead.  Nelson comes up and takes the cupcake.  ``Hey, look!
 They've got food at this thing!''  He then gives Bart a parting punch.

 The 3:15 bell rings.  Bart tries to sneak out (hiding behind ridiculous
 things), but Nelson blocks his way.
   
   Nelson:  Put 'em up!  [circles his fists]
   Bart:    [raises his hands in surrender]
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Nelson pummels a helpless Bart.  Bart eventually collapses.  ``Boy, you
 sure taught <me> a lesson.''  Bart is dragged off and dumped into a trash
 can.  ``I'm going to get you again tomorrow, Simpson.''  Bart takes a
 free ride in the garbage can down the street.  Bart mutters, ``Man, that
 guy's tough to love...''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:24ish]

 Bart climbs out of the garbage can onto the Simpsons front lawn.  He falls
 and crawls inside.  Marge seems concerned, but Homer just laughs it off.
 Bart goes into the bathroom, takes a quick look in the mirror (``I'm gonna
 miss ya, big guy'') and sits in the tub, moaning in pain.  Homer pops in,
 at Marge's insistence.  Bart tearfully asks Homer's help.  The first step
 is to dry Bart's tears, which Homer does with a high-power hair blower.
   
   Bart:  Well, I had a run-in with a... bully.
   Marge: [bursts in] A bully!?
   Homer: [annoyed] Come on, Marge!  I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa!
   Marge: Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
   Bart:  I... guess I could do that.
   Homer: What!?  And violate the code of the schoolyard!?
          I'd rather Bart die!
   Marge: What on earth are you talking about, Homer!?
   Homer: The code of the schoolyard, Marge!  The rules that teach a boy to be
          a man.  Let's see.  [enumerates them on his fingers] Don't tattle.
          Always make fun of those different from you.  Never say anything,
          unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do.
          What else...
   -- Rule number four:  Girls have cooties, ``Bart the General''
   
 Marge will hear nothing of this.
   
   Marge: This bully friend of yours.  Is he a little on the chunky side?
   Bart:  Yeah, he's pretty chunkified, all right.
   Marge: Mmm.  And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies, either.
   Bart:  No, he's pretty dumb.  He's in all the same special classes I am.
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Marge suggests he try talking it out, but Homer drags Bart away. ``Thank
 you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi.''

 Down in the rumpus room, Homer draws a face on a punching bag and invites
 Bart to do his worst.  Bart feebly punches it.  ``No, no, not like that.
 Like this!''  Homer leaps onto the bag, clawing and chewing.  He spits
 out a mouthful of cloth.
   
   Homer: You didn't expect that, did you.  And neither will he.
   Bart:  You mean that I should fight dirty, Dad?
   Homer: Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules
          a little in order to hold our own.
   Bart:  Amen!
   Homer: So the next time this bully thinks you're going to throw a punch,
          you throw a glob of mud in his eye!
          And then you sock him [pounds fist into hand] when he staggers
          around blinded!
   Bart:  [getting into it]  Yeah!
   Homer: And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
   Bart:  Gotcha.
   Homer: [quietly] And if you get the chance, get him right in the family jewels.
          That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.
          [punches the punching bag down low]
   Bart:  [cringes]  Thanks, Pop.
   -- The rules of the schoolyard, Simpson style, ``Bart the General''
   
 Bart skids to a halt on the schoolyard when Nelson appears.  Nelson squares
 off for a fistfight, so Bart throws mud in his eye.  Nelson rubs it off
 and marches onward.  Homer appears in a thought balloon.  ``The family
 jewels, son.''  Bart lunges for Nelson, who holds him safely away at
 arm's length.  Dream-Homer shrugs.  Bart's-eye view of Nelson's fist
 approaching.  Dream-Homer cringes as Bart is beaten (offscreen) to a pulp.
 His lucky red hat obvious didn't help.  ``Oh, no.  Not the can, please.''

 Lisa sits on the curb licking a green ice cream cone.  (Spearmint?
 Pistachio?)  Bart rolls in.  He coughs up his lucky red hat.
   
   Lisa: Why don't you go see Grampa?
   Bart: What can <he> do?
   Lisa: He'll give you good advice.  He's the toughest Simpson alive.
   Bart: He is?
   Lisa: Yeah, remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home?
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 At the Springfield Retirement Home, Bart asks to see Grampa.  Heads poke
 out of doors all down the hall.  Grampa Simpson.  Heads return, disappointed.
 Grampa types an angry letter.
   
   Dear Advertisers,
       I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television.
   We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs.  Many of us are bitter,
   resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment
   was bland and inoffensive.  The following is a list of words I never
   want to hear on television again.  Number one:  Bra.  Number two:  Horny.
   Number three:  Family Jewels.
   -- Grampa Simpson, ``Bart the General''
   
 Grampa tells Bart, ``If you don't stand up for yourself, bullies are going
 to be picking on you for the rest of your life.''  Jasper comes in and
 demands Grampa's newspaper so he can do the crossword.  A fierce struggle
 ensues, and Jasper wins.  Grampa realizes he can't be much help, but
 he knows someone who can.

 They go to Herman's Military Antiques.
   
   Herman: [whispers] What's the password?
   Grampa: Let me in, you idiot!
   Herman: Right you are.  [opens the door]
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Grampa introduces Bart.
   
   Bart:   Uh, Mr. Herman?
   Herman: Yes?
   Bart:   Did, did you lose your arm in the war?
   Herman: My arm?  Well, let me put it this way:  Next time your teacher tells
           you to keep your arm inside the bus window, you do it!
   Bart:   [nervously]  Yes, sir.  I will.
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Grampa explains that Bart's having trouble with a local bully named Nelson.
   
   Herman: How many men do you have?
   Bart:   None.
   Herman: You'll need more.
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 Herman produces a map.
   
   The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street.
   The Greeks knew it.  The Carthaginians knew it.  Now <you> know it.
   -- Herman, ``Bart the General''
   
   First, you'll need a declaration of war.  That way, everything you do will be
   nice and legal.
   -- Herman, giving Bart advice on dealing with a local bully,
      ``Bart the General''
   
 Herman uses a slightly modified one from the Franco-Prussian War.
   
   Bart:   Pssst.  Grampa, I think this guy's a little nuts.
   Grampa: Oh yeah?  Well, General George S. Patton was a little nuts.
           And this guy's completely out of his mind!  We can't fail!!
   -- ``Bart the General''
   
 [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:29ish]

 At Springfield Elementary, a note is passed around.  It reads, ``If you
 hate and fear Nelson, meet at Bart's treehouse.  1500 hrs.  (3pm).''

 Bart's treehouse is packed, but Bart is late.  He staggers in, bruised,
 coughs up his lucky red hat, and hangs it up.
   
   Bart:     Okay, we all know why we're here, right?
   Milhouse: No, why?
   Bart:     To fight Nelson, the bully.  That guy has been tormenting all of
             us for years, and I for one am sick of it!
             I can't promise you victory.  I can't promise you good times.
             But the one thing I do know...
             [all the kids file out]
             Whoa!  Whoa!

 Bart's infantry marches in time, each soldier equipped with a helmet.
   
   Bart: I got a B in arithmetic.
   Army: I got a B in arithmetic.
   Bart: Would have got an A but I was sick.
   Army: Would have got an A but I was sick.

 Swing-ring practice.  Milhouse misses a ring and falls to the ground.
 (``Aaagghh!'')  Then is knocked over by another trainee.  (``Aggh!'')

 Climbing the monkey bars.  A helmet falls.  Luckily, everyone below
 was wearing their helmets.

 Collision avoidance drills.  One of the kids falls into a dustbin.
 (``Oomph!'')
   
   Bart: We are rubber, you are glue.
   Army: We are rubber, you are glue.
   Bart: It bounces off of us and sticks to you.
   Army: It bounces off of us and sticks to you.

 Crossing the stream.  The rock in the middle of the water turns out to
 be a kid wearing a helmet.

 The kids march through mud as General Bart (wearing shades and chewing
 on a piece of grass) watches.

 Silhouetted against the setting sun, the kids climb the monkey bars.
 One kid slips.

 Munitions training.  Bart points at an easel, on which is mounted a
 schematic of a water balloon.  The balloon in Bart's hand bursts.

 Battle simulator.  Kids run past an angry dog.
   
   Bart: What's the matter with you, soldier!
   Boy:  It's my nerves, sir.  I just can't stand the barking any more.
   Bart: Your nerves!  [slaps the kid]  I won't have cowards in my army.
   Grampa: [whaps Bart]  Sorry, Bart.
         You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff,
         you can send them off to die on some God-forsaken rock, but for
         some reason you can't slap them.

   Bart: In English class I did the best.

 Simulated hand-to-hand.  The kids attack a stuffed bag.  Lewis uses a
 plunger.  Another boy uses a dust mop.  Milhouse attacks with a fly
 swatter.

 Bart calls, ``Okay, next group!  Martinez!  Steinberg!  O'Hara!  Chang!
 Olajuwan!  Herman!''  Herman attacks the bag with a bayonet.
   
   Bart: We are happy, we are merry.

 In the treehouse, a scale model of Springfield is laid out on the table,
 with saltshakers used to indicate troop placement and strengths.  During
 the strategic planning, the shakers are pushed around with those pusher
 things Army people use.  Intelligence reports that Nelson shakes down
 kids at the video arcade for quarters, then heads to the Kwik-E-Mart for
 a cherry Squishee.
   
   Herman: When he leaves the Kwik-E-Mart, we start the saturation bombing.
           You got the water balloons?
   Bart:   [salutes]  Two hundred rounds, sir.  [holds a balloon]
           Is it okay if they say `Happy Birthday' on the side?
   Herman: Urgh.  I'd rather they say `Death from Above', but I guess we're stuck.
   -- Saturation bombing with a smile, ``Bart the General''
   
 Herman sketches the strategy.

   heaven for children!

 Nelson and his two goons return from their Squishee-fest, and Bart blocks
 their path.  ``Nelson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.''
 ``Oh yeah?  You and what army?''  ``This one.''  Bart's troops emerge from
 their hiding places, water balloons poised.  (One accidentally goes off
 early.)  Bart yells, ``Commence saturation bombing!''  Nelson and his
 goons are pummelled with water balloons.  They make a run for it, but
 their escape route is blocked off.  Nelson runs past the Simpsons house,
 with the army in hot pursuit.

--Episode: Moaning Lisa 
 Breakfast time at the Simpsons.  Homer runs frantically into the kitchen.
 Lisa pokes at her breakfast.
   
   Homer: Where the hell are my keys?  Who stole my keys?  Come on, I'm
          late for work!  [lift Maggie and looks underneath]
   Marge: Oh Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to
          your neck.

           of you.
   Bart:   Well Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes

 Mr. Largo (the music teacher) conducts the school band through a horrid
 rendition of ``My Country 'Tis of Thee''.  Lisa improvises wildly.
   
   Largo: [tapping on music stand]  Lisa.  [taps louder]  LISA SIMPSON!
          [finally attracting her attention]  Lisa, there's no room for
          crazy bebop in ``My Country 'Tis of Thee''.
   Lisa:  But Mr. Largo!  That's what my country's all about.
   Largo: What?!?
   Lisa:  I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of a car.  The
          idle farmer whose land has been taken away by uncaring
          bureaucrats.  The West Virginia coal-miner caught...
   Largo: Well, that's all fine and good, but Lisa, none of those unpleasant
          people are going to be at the recital next week.  Now class, from
          the top.  Five, six, seven...
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Lisa conforms.

 At lunchtime...
   
   Lisa: Every day at noon a bell rings, and they herd us in here to
         feeding time.  So we sit around like cattle, chewing our cud,
         dreading the inevitable...
   Bart: A-ha!  Food fight!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Everyone except Lisa gets into the act.  Janey packs a mashed
 potatoes-ball and asks, ``Come on Lis, what are you waiting for?''
 Lisa responds, ``I choose not to participate.''  She is the unhappy
 recipient of a glob of mashed potatoes.

 Phys ed.  Lisa is pelted by multiple utility balls.
   
   Lisa:  OW!  Ooh, ow!  Ooh!
   PE Teacher: [blows whistle]  Lisa!  We are playing dodge-ball here.
          The object of the game is to avoid the ball, by weaving or ducking
          out of its path.
   Lisa:  In other words, to dodge the ball.
   PE Teacher: Listen missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way
          of those balls.
   Lisa:  [despairingly]  I'm too sad.
   PE Teacher: Too sad to play dodgeball?  That's ridiculous. [to the rest of the
          class]  Now let's see some enthusiasm.  Play Ball!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Several more enthusiastic utility balls hit Lisa.

 At home, Homer and Bart play the ``Super Slugfest'' video boxing game.
   
   Homer: Come on, come on, let's go.
   Bart:  [as announcer]
          In the red trunks, with a record of 48 wins and no losses, the
          undisputed champ of the town, Battling Bart Simpson!
          [whistles] whoopee, wo wo wo!
          And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and 48
          defeats... oh, correction, <humiliating> defeats, all of them by
          knock-out.

   Bart:  Homer ``the human punching bag'' Simpson!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Round 1.  Homer immediately hits the canvas.  ``Whoa, three seconds folks,
 a new record!''  Homer manages to jiggle the joystick enough to get his
 man off the canvas, to suffer more at the hands of Battling Bart.  Marge
 and Lisa come in, as Homer's boxer bleeds.
   
   Marge:  They sent a note from school.
   Homer:  [to Bart]  What did you do this time you little hoodlum?
   Bart:   I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, there's no way you can prove
           anything!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 But this note is about Lisa.  Even Bart finds it hard to believe.
 When Homer takes the note, Bart literally knocks the video boxing
 character's block off.  Lisa sighs.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 4:48]
   
   Homer:  [reading the note]  Lisa refuses to play dodgeball because she is
           sad.  [end of note]  She doesn't look sad.  I don't see any tears
           in her eyes.
   Lisa:   It's not that kind of sad.  I'm sorry Dad, but you wouldn't
           understand.
   Homer:  Oh sure I would, Princess.  I have feeling too, you know, like
           ``My stomach hurts', or ``I'm going crazy!''
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 She climbs up onto her father's knee.  Lisa muses, ``I'm just wondering
 what's the point.  Would it make any difference at all if I never existed?
 How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?''
 Unable to respond to these deep questions, Homer says, ``Come on Lisa, ride
 the Homer horsey!  Giddy up!  Wheee!  heh heh heh.''  Marge offers to
 run her a hot bath like when she feels sad.
   
   Lisa:  Sorry Dad, I know you mean well.  [kisses him]
   Homer: Thanks for knowing I mean well.

          to it boy!

 With Maggie watching from the couch, Bart grouses as he vacuums the living
 room floor... and a pack of playing cards from the table.  Lisa enters
 wearing her bathrobe.
   
   Bart:   [sarcastically]  Enjoy your bath?
   Lisa:   No, not really.
   Bart:   Oh, too bad.  Well I've certainly had fun vacuuming.  Maybe now
           I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
   Lisa:   [to Maggie] So typical of Bart.  All he thinks about is himself.

   Bart:   Is too!  Watch, I'll prove it.  Maggie, come to the one you love
           best.
   Maggie: [hops off the couch, looks at Bart]
   Lisa:   No Maggie!  Come here girl, come to me.
   Bart:   [shaking a rattler]  Come on Maggie, the choice is obvious.
   Lisa:   [beckoning her]  No Maggie, don't go for the glitter, look for
           substance.
   Maggie: [looks at them both, uncertain]
   Lisa:   [giving up] All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
   Bart:   Egg-zactly, come to the one you love best.
   Maggie: [looks at them both, then walks away and embraces the TV set]
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Homer and Bart sit down to play another game of video boxing.  Homer
 wields his joystick furiously.  Bart uses a single finger to dispatch
 his opponent and dances on the grave of the defeated.  Homer's
 excuse is the ``infernal racket'' coming from upstairs.

 Homer runs into Lisa's room.
   
   Homer: Lisa!  What did I tell you about playing that saxamuhthing in the
          house?
   Lisa:  I was just playing the blues... Dad. [sobs]
   Homer: Lisa, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to yell.  Go ahead, play your
          blues if it'll make you happy.
   Lisa:  No, that's okay, Dad.  I'll just work on my fingering, unless my
          fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
   Homer: Let's hear it.  [Lisa clacks away]  You just clack as loud as you
          want, Lis.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 The tones of another saxophone reach through the bedroom window.
 ``Gotta find that sound,'' says Lisa.  Out the window, to the treehouse,
 then down the ladder.  She treks through Springfield, locating another
 musician sitting on the Springfield bridge.
   
   Lisa:   That was beautiful.  What's it called?
   Murphy: Oh, it's a little tune that I call ``The `I Never Had an Italian
           Suit' Blues''.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Marge sleeps restlessly.  She dreams of her childhood.  Marge's mother
 (who looks just like Marge, but with a puffier hairdo) tells her
 daughter, ``Wait Margey, before we go out that door, let's put our
 happy face on, because people know how good a mommy you have by the size
 of your smile.''  Young Marge sports a ridiculous smile.
   
 Homer meanwhile lapses into a video game nightmare, except the video
 characters are real, not pixels.  The two combatants are, of course,
 Bart and Homer.
   
   Homer:  [in a dream] What the?!?!  [Homer is a video boxing character]
   Bart:   [his opponent] Put up your dukes, Homer.
   Homer:  Agggh!  Bart!  Go easy on me!  I'm your Dad!
   Bart:   I <am> going easy on ya.  [pow] You're so old, [pow] and slow,
           [pow] and weak, [pow] and pathetic.  [Bart winds up for the kill]
   Homer:  No!  Son!  No!  [the fist impacts]
           [wakes up screaming]
           Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Homer promptly settles back to sleep as if nothing happened.
 Marge wakes up Homer, wiping off the drool.
   
   You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing.  I think the
   saddest day of my life was when I realized I could beat my Dad at
   most things, and Bart experienced that at the age of four.
   -- Homer, ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Marge is still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa.
   
   Marge:  I don't know... Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs
           attention, but all the while, our little Lisa's becoming a young
           woman.
   Homer:  Oh, so that's it, this is some kind of underwear thing.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Homer returns to sleep, but Marge remains awake.

 Murphy tutors the fine art of the sax to Lisa on Springfield Bridge.
   
   Lisa:    [improvises]
   Murphy:  Now now now, low B flat.
   Lisa:    [jams down low]
   Murphy:  Okay, Lisa.  Altissimo register.
   Lisa:    [another wild riff]
   Murphy:  [applauding]  Very nice, very nice.  I once ruptured myself
            doing that.
   -- All you ever wanted to know about sax, ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Lisa thanks Mr. Murphy for the compliment, but he would rather be known
 as...
   
   Murphy:  My friends call me `Bleeding Gums'.
   Lisa:    Ewwww, how'd you get a name like that?
   Murphy:  Well let me put it this way... You ever been to the dentist?
   Lisa:    Yeah.
   Murphy:  Not me.  I suppose I should go to one, but I've got enough pain
            in my life as it is.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Lisa adds, ``I have problems too.''  Murphy responds, ``Well I can't help
 you kid.  I'm just a terrific horn player with tones of soul, but I can
 jam widcha.''  They do.
   
   Murphy:  Oh, I'm so lonely,
            Since my baby left me.
            I got no money,
            And nothing is free.
            Oh, I've been so alone
            Since the day I was born.
            All I got is this rusty,
            This rusty old horn.
   Lisa:    I got a bratty brother.
            He bugs me everyday.
            And this morning my own mother,
            Gave my last cupcake away.
            My Dad acts like he belongs,
            He belongs in the zoo.
            I'm the sa-a-a-addest kid,
            In gra-a-a-de number two.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa'
   
 But none of this makes Lisa feel any better.
   
   The Blues isn't about feeling better, it's about making other
   people feel <worse>, and making a few bucks while you're at it.
   -- Bleeding Gums Murphy, ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Marge drives by.
   
   Marge:  Lisa!  Get away from that jazz man!
   Lisa:   But Mom!  Can I stay a little longer?  Can I Mom, can I?
   Marge:  Come on, come on.  We were worried about you.
           [to Bleeding Gums Murphy]
           Nothing personal, I just fear the unfamiliar.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Lisa gets in, and Murphy solos through the night.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:03]

 Homer chows down on Pork Rinds Light in front of the TV set.
   
   Kent:  ... through downtown Springfield today gutting Symphony Hall, the
          Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts
          Center, and Barney's Bowl-o-rama.
   Homer: Waugh!  [chokes]  Oh no!  [walks into kitchen]  Marge!  Marge, you
          all right?
   Marge: No, I'm very upset.
   Homer: Oh then you've heard.  Oh God!  What are we going to do?  The
          lanes were kinda warped, but all the food...
   Marge: I'm upset about Lisa.
   Homer: [realizing]  Oh, me too.
   Bart:  Me three, whatawe talking about?
   Homer: Bart!
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
   Marge: Do you think you could be nice enough to your sister, Bart?
   Bart:  Oh yeah, easy.
   Marge: You do love her don't you?
   Bart:  [whining] Oh Mom...
   Marge: Well you do, don't you?
   Bart:  [uncomfortably]  Don't make me say it.  You know the answer, I
          know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it, ok?
   Marge: Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a
          loving attitude.  Be nice to your sister.
   Bart:  [reluctantly]  Okey dokey.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Bart sees Lisa coming down the stairs with her saxophone.  ``Hi, man!''
 But she doesn't want his pity.  Bart offers to cheer her up.

 Moe picks up the phone.
   
   Moe:   Yeah, Moe's Tavern, Moe speaking.
   Bart:  Is Jock there?
   Moe:   Who?
   Bart:  Jock, last name Strap.
   Moe:   Uh, hold on.  [to everyone in the bar]  Uh, Jock... Strap...
          Hey guys I'm looking for a Jock Strap.  [laughs from all]
          Oh... wait a minute... Jock Strap...
          It's you isn't it ya cowardly little runt?  When I get a hold of you,
          I'm gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
   -- ``Moaning Lisa''
   
 Bart rolls on the floor laughing.  Lisa isn't impressed.  ``Where's your
 sense of humor man?''  Marge leaves with Lisa for band practice.
 Meanwhile, Homer pays a visit to the Noiseland Video Arcade.
   
   Homer: Give me some quarters... I'm doing my laundry.
   Clerk: Yeah, right.  [gives him the quarters]
   Homer: [looks around] Where's the video boxing?
   Clerk: Over there in the corner.  If I were you I really would use
          those quarters for laundry.
   Homer: [sotto voce]  Wise guy.

--Episode: Call of the Simpsons 
 Cowboy Bob ignores Marge's repeated questions as to the Behemoth's price.

   Homer: Does it have a deep fryer?
   Bob:   Four.  One for each part of the chicken.
   -- The Simpsons shop for an RV, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 Cowboy Bob shows them inside.  Fireplace.  Giant-screen TV.  Full-sized
 refrigerator.  Crystal chandelier.

   Bart: Aye, Carumba!
   Lisa: This is better than our house!
   -- The Simpsons shop for an RV, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 Homer finally asks how much it costs.  Cowboy Bob lays it on thick and
 takes Homer to the credit office.  There, he assures Homer that the
 credit check is purely a formality, but it's part of the procedure.
 ``I don't own the place, even though my name's up there.  Long story.''

   Bob:   [running a credit check]  [presses `Enter']
          [sirens wail and lights flash]
   Homer: Is that a good siren?  Am I approved?
   Bob:   You ever known a siren to be good?
   -- The only good siren is a dead siren, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 ``That was the computer [...] telling me, sell the vehicle to this fellow
 and you're out of business.''

   Homer: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range?
          I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
   Bob:   Take it easy, willya, huh?  You'll ruin this feeling I'm getting
          from ya...
   -- Shopping for an RV, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 He shows them a bucket of bolts that is miraculously still in one piece.
 Homer asks, ``Is it used?''

   Simpson, you'll never own a better RV, and I don't mean that in a good way.
   I mean, literally, buddy.  This is for you, you know.  It's this or a wagon.
   -- Cowboy Bob sells Homer an RV, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 Cowboy Bob pulls every slimy tactic in the book to panic Homer into buying
 the RV.  The rest of the family don't seem too happy by the turn of events.

 The RV coughs to a stop in front of the Flanders' house, where Homertakes
 the opportunity to gloat.  He then turns his attention to his family.

   Homer: Everybody ready?
   Bart:  I hate this.  I don't want to go.
   Homer: That's the spirit!
   -- Going camping, ``Call of the Simpsons''

   Ready or not, Nature, here we come!
   -- Homer takes the family camping, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 The RV (packed to the gills) putters down the street.

 Traffic has backed up behind the slow-moving RV.

   Bart:  Turkey farm?       Skunks?       Slaughterhouse?
   Lisa:                No.           No.                   No.

   -- Games to play in the car, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 Bart whines, ``Are we there yet?''  Homer replies, ``Go back to your smell

 The RV makes a turn off the main road, and it wanders through the woods.
 Marge consults her map.

   Marge: Homer, I'm telling you, this is not the Interstate.
   Homer: Pffffft.  Maps.

 ``Don't worry, this is an all-terrain vehicle!''  Homer tests the hypothesis
 by driving into a lake.  Marge's feet get wet.

   Lisa:  Mom, I'm scared.
   Marge: Don't worry.  We all are.
   -- Safety in numbers, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 The RV returns to dry land, and Homer throws the RV into high gear.
 (Amazing!  It has more than one gear!)  The RV crashes through bushes.
 Homer asks, ``Whaddya think, should we stop here?''  Everybody yells,
 ``YEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!''  Homer slams on the brakes.  Curious, the horizon
 is nowhere to be seen through the front window.  The RV tips forward:
 It's balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff.  Everyone screams.
 And screams.  And screams some more.

   Homer: [speaking softly and slowly]
          When I give the word, everyone ever-so-slowly open the door
          and slide out.  On the count of three...  One...

   -- But will the forest survive?  ``Call of the Simpsons''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:09]

 Homer tries to put a good face on things.

   Homer: Yes sir!  This is a real adventure!  Why, I bet there are people who
          would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like
          this.
   Bart:  You mean like <we> just did?
   -- The Simpsons have entered the forest, sans RV, ``Call of the Simpsons''

 Trying to cheer up Maggie, Lisa points up into the sky.  ``Look, Maggie.
 Birdies!''  Vultures circle overhead.

   Marge: Oh Homer... What are we going to do?
   Homer: Now, don't worry.  Our situation isn't as bad as it seems.
          And you're forgetting---I'm an experienced woodsman!

 That evening, Homer ``finishes'' building some sort of shelter-like thing
 out of twigs and a fallen log.  Not very impressive.

   Lisa:  Remember, Dad.  The handle of the Big Dipper points towards
          the North Star.

 distorted view of Principal Skinner.  Bart escapes to his room as Marge
 brings Principal Skinner into the living room.  Homer remains on the couch.
   
   Homer:  Oh, hello, Principal Skinner.  I'd get up, but the boy crippled me.
   Principal Skinner: Mm hm.  I understand completely.
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
   Pr. Skinner:  Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible.
          I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick.  I think it
          behooves us all to consider... deportation.
   Marge: Deportation!?  You mean, kick Bart out of the country?
   Homer: Eh, hear him out, Marge.
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Skinner admits to being overly melodramatic.
   
   Pr. Skinner:  Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange
          program.  Normally, a student is selection on the basis of academic
          excellence or intelligence.  But in Bart's case... I'm prepared to
          make a <big> exception.  And if you're willing to play along, he can
          be spending the next three months studying far, far away.
   Homer: Sounds great!
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Marge scolds Homer for agreeing even without knowing what country Bart
 is going to.
   
   Pr. Skinner: He'd be staying in France, in a lovely chateau in the heart
          of the wine country.
   Marge: But Bart doesn't speak French.
   Pr. Skinner: Oh, when he's fully immersed in a foreign language, the average
          child can become fluent in weeks!
   Homer: Yeah, but what about Bart?
   Pr. Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by.
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 The Simpsons will be asked to host a student in exchange.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:44]

 At Springfield International Airport, Marge kisses her ``special little guy''
 good-bye.  Lisa scowls, ``What do you know about France?''  Bart sneers
 back, ``I know I'm going and you're not.''

 Bart is (literally) loaded onto the plane.  Meanwhile, in Tirana, Albania,
 a young boy bids farewell to his family.  (Mom, Dad, boy, sister, and baby
 girl.  Hmm...)

 Upon arrival in Paris, Bart is greeted by a surly young gentleman.  ``Okay,
 kid, let's go.''  Bart rides sidecar through the French countryside to
 Ch\^ateau Maison, a dilapidated vineyard.  An older man tells his donkey,
 ``Ah, Maurice.  Once the American boy arrives, your days of back-breaking
 work labor will be over.''  Bart arrives.

 Meanwhile, the rest of the family await the arrival of the exchange student.
 Lisa reads from a reference book.
   
   Lisa:  You know, in Albania, the unit of currency is called the lek.
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  The lek!
   Lisa:  And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
   Homer: Give me the ol' stars-and-stripes!
   Lisa:  And the main export is furious political thought.
   Homer: Political what?
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 The plane carrying the exchange student lands.

 Meanwhile, the older gentleman (Cesar) introduces his nephew Huguolin (the
 gentleman who picked up Bart at the airport).
   
   You will find life here at the ch\^ateau hard, but if you shut up and
   do exactly what we say, the time will pass more quickly.
   -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 ``He's right, you know,'' adds Huguolin.

 The young boy deplanes and greets the family members by name.  He kisses
 Homer once on each cheek.  ``Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he.''

 Bart's hosts go through his luggage and divvy up the proceeds.

 The students are gathered to welcome Adil Hoxha.
   
   You might find his accent peculiar.  Certain aspects of his culture may seem
   absurd, perhaps even offensive.  But I urge you all to give little Adil the
   benefit of the doubt.  This way, and only in this way, do we hope to better
   understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.
   -- Principal Skinner's introduction, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Adil addresses his fellow students.

 Cesar, Huguolin, and Maurice walk cheerfully along, followed by Bart,
 straining under the weight of water buckets.

 Dinnertime at the Simpsons.
   
   Adil:  How can you defend a country where five percent of the people
          control ninety-five percent of the wealth?
   Lisa:  I'm defending a country where people can think and act
          and worship any way they want.
   Adil:  Cannot!
   Lisa:  Can too!
   Adil:  Cannot!
   Lisa:  Can too!
   Homer: Please, please, kids, stop fighting.
          Maybe Lisa's right about America being the land of opportunity,
          and maybe Adil's got a point about the machinery of capitalism
          being oiled with the blood of the workers.
   -- The thoughts of a worker who does not control the means of production,

          <I> will clear the dishes.
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
   Did you see that?  This is the way I always wanted it to be!  We've become
   a fully-functioning family unit!  We've always blamed ourselves, but I
   guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
   -- Homer trades Bart for Adil, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Lisa leaves the table in disgust.
   
   Oh, she's just jealous.  She'll get over it.
   And if she doesn't, we can always exchange her!  Heh, heh, heh.
   -- Homer on Lisa's recent ourburst, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Cesar and Huguolin enjoy their dinner of sausage, while Bart eats a raw
 turnip.  Huguolin orders Bart to go to sleep, and points at a pile of hay.
 But Maurice beats Bart to it, leaving our hero to sleep on the floor.

 Homer tucks Adil into bed.
   
   Homer: Look, Adil, you can call me `Dad'.
   Adil:  All right... `Dad'.
   Homer: Awwww, you called me `Dad'.

 Homer gladly agrees.  Adil says quietly to himself, ``Excellent...''

 Cesar instructs Bart on the proper way to pluck grapes.  ``Now do it a
 million times.''

 Homer takes Adil to SNPP.
   
   See these?  American donuts.  Glazed, powdered, and raspberry-filled.
   Now, how's <that> for freedom of choice!
   -- Homer introduces Adil to the American workplace, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Adil asks to see the plutonium isolation module.

   Lenny: Yeah, in Sector 12.
   Homer: Sector 12?
   Lenny: Third floor, by the candy machine.
   Homer: Oh, <that> Sector 12!
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Bart carefully plucks grapes.  He looks around and pops one into his
 mouth.  Huguolin whaps him on the back, causing Bart to spit out the
 grape. ``Ungrateful swine!  We give you food, we give you shelter, and
 this is how you repay us?''

 A radiation-suited Adil snaps photos furiously as Homer takes him through
 the plant.  They reach the plutonium isolation module, marked ``TOP SECRET''.
 Adil snaps away, and Homer keeps leaning into the frame to wave hello.
 ``D'oh, wait a minute.''  Homer removes his radiation hood and smiles
 for the camera.

 Bart unhappily stomps grapes.  ``I hate France, ungh, ungh, ungh.''

 Marge and Homer chat in bed.  A framed portrait of Adil hangs on the wall.
 Marge makes Homer admit that he loves Bart, and Homer makes Marge admit
 that Adil is a very sweet boy.  (``Darn tootin'!'')

 Pan out Bart's window to the treehouse, which is filled with electronics
 equipment.  Adil prepares a fax machine and tunes his radio.  ``Sparrow to
 Nest.  Sparrow to Nest.  Stand by for transmission.''  In Tirana, the fax
 is received.  ``I told you the Sparrow would not fail.''  The two generals
 admire the photo of the plutonium isolation module, with a smiling Homer
 standing in front of it.

 [End of Act Two.]

 His feet purple with grape juice, Bart reads a letter from Marge.
   
   We think Maggie may say her first word any day now.
   -- Marge's letter to Bart, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Bart finishes the letter, moans quietly, and blows out the candle.

 Cesar and Huguolin inspect the wine vats.  Cesar is optimistic about this
 year's harvest, but Huguolin notes that the wine has been fermenting for
 only three days.
   
   Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supr\^emes faiblit,
   je pense toujours au miracle de l'anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
   Whenever my faith in God is shaken, I think of the miracle of anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 ``Too much can be poison, but the right amount gives wine just the right
 kick.''  Cesar mixes some antifreeze with the wine.  Bart coughs outside,
 and Cesar shoos him away, then reconsiders.  He invites Bart in.  (``Watch.
 I bet it won't even blind him.'')
   
   Cesar: [shoves a cup of wine in Bart's face]  Drink this.
   Bart:  Oh, no thanks.
   Cesar: Do not worry.  This is France.  It is customary for children to take
          a little wine now and then.
   Bart:  Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.
   Cesar: Drink it!
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Bart swallows hard, downs the wine, belches, and waits.  Cesar waves his
 hand in front of Bart's face.
   
   He sees well enough.  Now go buy a case of anti-freeze.
   -- Cesar, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Huguolin doesn't want to go out in the rain, so they send Bart.

 Bart pedals to Paris in search of 14 Rue Voltaire, but gives up.  He flags
 down a passing policeman.  Unfortunately, there's a language problem.
 The policeman unwraps a candy.  ``Voil\`a un bonbon.''  Bart reluctantly
 takes it but is unable to communicate.  ``Je suis d\'esol\'e.''  Bart
 walks away, dejected.
   
   I'm so stupid.  Anybody could've learned this dumb language by now.
   Here, I've listened to nothing but French for the past |{deux mois,}
                                                          |[two months,]
   {et je ne sais pas un mot.}
   [And I haven't learned a word.]
   {Eh!  Mais, je parle Fran\c{c}ais maintenant!}
   [Wait!  I'm talking French now!]
   {Incroyable!}
   [Incredible!]
   -- Bart learns French, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 He rushes back to the policeman.
   
   Bart: You gotta help me.  These two guys work me night and day.
         They don't feed me.  They make me sleep on the floor.
         They put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave
         my red hat to the donkey.
   Policeman: [shocked]
         Anti-freeze in the wine?  That is a very serious crime.
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 Homer arrives home with something tucked under his arm.
   
   Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted.
   I'm telling you, he's such a curious little Dickens.
   I bet he could <build> a nukeeler power plant if he wanted to!
   -- Homer fetches classified information for Adil, ``The Crepes of Wrath''
   
 A voice calls to the Sparrow to surrender.  Homer goes outside to see
 what the to-do is about.
   
   Homer: I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?
   Agent: [through the megaphone]  Well, sir, the...
          [turns off the megaphone] Well, sir...
   -- ``The Crepes of Wrath''
 During the commerical (for Duff Beer), Homer talks to Bart about Krusty.
   
   Homer: Bart, you know that guy on your lunchbox?
   Bart:  Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
   Homer: He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
   Bart:  Are you kidding?  He's my idol!
          I've based my life on Krusty's teaching.
   -- Krusticism?  ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 Homer tries to get Bart out of the room before the news returns, but too
 late.  Bart: ``Gasp!  Krusty!''  Lisa:  ``Oh, no!''  Maggie: *suck* *suck*.
   
   Earlier this evening, the Springfield SWAT team apprehended
   the TV clown, who appears on a rival station, opposite our
   own Emmy award winning Hobo Hate.
   -- Scott Christian's news flash, ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 And just in, surveillance film from the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
 Homer's remark about the ``gruesome twosome'' is broadcast for all to hear.
 Bart is crushed, but Marge suggests that perhaps Krusty is innocent.
   
   Earth-to-Marge.  Earth-to-Marge.  I was there.  The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.
   -- Homer, ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 In his room, Bart glumly stares at his huge Krusty poster, then picks up
 a Krusty doll.  He pulls the string, and it says, ``You're
 my best friend.''  Another pull.  ``Buy my cereal!  Wuh-huh-huh-huh!''
 And, ``<I> didn't do it!''

 [End of Act One.  Time: 7:14]

 Over a snazzy graphic ``Krusty Gets Busted'', Kent Brockman anchors the news.
   
   Good evening again, Springfield.  Krusty the Klown, the beloved idol of
   countless tots, now nothing more than a common (alleged) criminal.
   -- Kent Brockman reports... ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
   His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media
   circus, as children of all ages, from 8 to 80, hang onto each new
   development like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
   -- Kent Brockman reports... ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 He continues, ``From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo,
 Mississippi, Krusty climbed to the top of a personal mini-empire, with
 dozens of endorsements including his line own line of pork products.
 This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers, his near
 fatal heart-attack, in 1986.''
   
   Krusty: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids?
           Well, we've got another one coming right up.
           But first!  I've got a hankerin' for some pork products!
           [Sideshow Bob wheels in a barebecue grill]
           Mmmm.... Look!  Plump, succulent sausage.  Honey-smoked bacon.

 ``But a triple-bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back.  However,
 he was a changed clown.  Where his show had been condemned by parents and
 educators alike as simple-minded TV mayhem...''  Sideshow Bob slowly mashes
 a cream pie into Krusty's face.  Krusty punches Sideshow Bob in the mouth.
 ``... this `new' Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping
 out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a-thrill youth.''  Krusty holds
 up a book (upside-down) and says, ``Give a hoot!  Read a book!''

 Reverend Lovejoy calls upon the citizens of Springfield to gather up the
 merchandise related to the ``Clown Prince of Corruption'' for a public
 burning.

 Krusty's trial begins tomorrow.  Fade to an un-made-up Krusty in prison
 garb, taken into the courthouse.
   
   Bart:   Look at him.  His clothes are so drab.
   Lisa:   His face is so flesh-colored and sad.
   Bart:   And his feet.  They're so small.
           [grabs Krusty] Say it ain't so, Krusty!
   Atty:   Uh, my client has no comment at this time.
   Krusty; [meekly]  I didn't do it!

   -- Just picture them in their underwear, ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 The prosecuting attorney calls Homer to the stand.  Bart begs Homer not to
 do it, to no avail.
   
   Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of
   heavily-salted snack treats?
   -- Prosecutor at Krusty's trial, ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 The prosecutor invites Homer to point out the man who held up the
 Kwik-E-Mart.   Homer raises his finger and sees Bart silently begging
 and pleading.  Homer fingers Krusty.  Bart puts his head in his hands.
 (``Oh, man...'')  The prosecutor asks that the record show that Homer
 ``eventually'' pointed at Krusty.

 In Lisa's room, Marge tosses all Krusty-related merchandise into a
 brown paper bag, including the Krusty pacifier Maggie is sucking on.
   
   These toys are just adorable.  Who would have guessed they were inspired
   by an insane criminal genius.
   -- Marge throws out Krusty-related toys, ``Krusty Gets Busted''
   
 Maggie puts a new pacifier in her mouth.  Homer meanwhile loads up a
 wheelbarrow with the Krusty stuff in Bart's room.
   
   Bart:  Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality!
   Homer: No I'm not, I'm hopping on the bandwagon!
          Now come on, son, get with the winning team!

--Episode: Some enchanted evening 
 At the plant, Homer listens to the radio.  Dr. Monroe snuffs out his
 cigarette, reaches for another donut, and selects his next call.
   
   Dr.MM: Next we have Marge.  She's 34 and trapped in a loveless sham of
          a marriage.
   Homer: Hey, turn it up!  I love hearing those wackos!
   -- The SNPP workers listen to a radio call-in show, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
   Dr.MM: [radio talk show therapist]  Tell me about your husband, Marge.
   Marge: [on the phone] When we were dating, he was sweeter... and more
          romantic! ...  [beginning to sob]  And forty pounds thinner,
          and he had hair... [burbling barely coherently]  And he ate
          with utensils!  [breaks down crying]
   -- Marge calls KBBL, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Homer refuses to believe that it's his wife calling.
   
   Dr.MM: Your husband sees you as nothing.
   Marge: [pause]  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you.  [about to hang up]
   Dr.MM: No no no, don't hang up!
   -- Marge calls a radio talk show therapist, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 The plant employees nudge each other knowingly.
   
   Dr.MM: The pig has made you into his mother.
          You are not the hot love object you deserve to be!
   Marge: Really?
   Dr.MM: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying.
          Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got
          to tell him you're fed up, and if he doesn't start loving you,
          you will be leaving.
   Marge: Leave Homer!?
   Dr.MM: Please!  Don't use his real name!
   Marge: Leave Pedro!?
   -- Marge calls a radio talk show therapist, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 The employees crack up.  Homer swallows hard.

 At the Simpsons residence...
   
   Lisa: Aw, come on, Bart, not again!
   Bart: [dialing the phone] Aw, where's your sense of humor.
   Moe:  Moe's Tavern.
   Bart: Hello, is Al there?
   Moe:  Al?
   Bart: Yeah, Al.  Last name:  Coholic.

         who you are, I'm gonna kill you!
   -- ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Homer's at the bar, dreading going home.  While Homer eats a pickled

 egg, he explains that Marge is going to leave him because he's a pig.

 Moe agrees; he <is> a pig.  Homer goes for a second opinion.

   
   Homer:  Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
   Barney: You're even more of a pig than I am!   [huge belch]
   -- From someone who should know, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
   Moe: Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the
        town.  Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
   -- Gee, I didn't mean to put you to so much trouble, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 And after dinner, Moe suggests they check into a motel.  Homer likes the
 idea and heads out.

 The kids sit at the dinner table.  ``Wow, a quarter past six.  What's
 keeping Dad?'' asks Lisa.  Bart mutters, ``Yeah, he couldn't possibly
 be late on Meatloaf Night.''

 Homer wanders into the florist shop.
   
   Homer:   [unsure of himself]  Uh, I'd like some flowers.
   Florist: What kind of flowers?
   Homer:   Uh, you know, pretty ones, not dead.
   Florist: Well, we've have some beautiful long-stemmed roses.  They're $55
            a dozen.
   Homer:   [thinks]  One, please.
   -- Think small, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 It's now 8:35.  Marge stares angrily at the front door, growling.
 The kids approach her from behind with their empty plates and ask for
 some food.  Marge turns around and *ROARS*.  The kids scream and dash
 off in fright.  Marge turns back towards the door and waits...

 [End of Act One.  Time: 5:33]

 As Marge growls at the door, evil thoughts penetrate her mind, and her
 eyes turn red...

 Outside in the rain, Homer holds a heart-shaped box of candy in one hand
 and a wilted rose in the other.  He practices his entrance, but realizes
 it's no use and just heads for the door.  Marge pulls the door open as
 Homer tries to insert the key.  Stunned, Homer holds up the candy and
 the flower.  ``I love you, Marjorie.''  Marge softens, and they kiss.

 In the kitchen, Bart dials the phone...
   
   Bart: [dialing the phone] A little pre-dinner entertainment.
   Moe:  [answering the phone]  Moe's Tavern.
   Bart: Is Oliver there?
   Moe:  Who?

 Homer fills Marge in on their itinerary...
   
   Homer: And, I made reservations at Chez [pron. /chez/] Paree!
   Marge: Oh, but Homer, that's expensive!
   Homer: It matters not, mon frere!
   -- A night on the town with the boys?  ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Marge picks up the phone to call a babysitter, and hears Moe:  ``Listen,
 you lousy bum, if I ever get a hold of you, I <swear> I'll cut
 your belly open!''  She hangs up, figuring it was a crossed wire,
 and tries again.  She calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting
 Service, but they refuse when she identifies herself as Mrs. Simpson.
   
   Clerk: Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service!
   Homer: Hello, this is Mr... Sam-son.
   Clerk: Did your wife just call a second ago?
   Homer: No, I said Samson, not Simpson.
   -- Just checking, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
   Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a
   quite misunderstood and underrated family.
   -- Homer pretends to be Mr. Samson, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Upstairs, Lisa watches Marge pretty herself up for a night out.
 Bart listens to Homer talk about his mambo dancing, but his smart
 mouth gets him thrown out.  Homer shaves (and his beard grows back
 almost immediately).

 The doorbell rings, and Homer tells Bart to answer it.
   
   Aye-aye, Mambo-Man!
   -- Bart, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Bart slides down the banister (*thud*) and answers the door as Lisa
 and Maggie join him.  He opens the door.  The kids swallow hard.
 It's the babysitter.  (Insert jarring chord.)  Curiously, Ms. Botz
 has brought two suitcases.  Marge leaves her with brief instructions:
 Maggie should be put to bed immediately; Bart and Lisa can watch
 ``The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cub''.
   
   [moaning] Oh!  The Elves!  The Elves!
   -- Quasi-Bart-o, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Marge kisses the kids good-bye.  Bart tries to get Ms. Botz to approve
 alternate viewing, but a menacing threat puts him in his place.  Ms. Botz
 carries Maggie away to bed.  (Maggie waves bye-bye.)

 At the restaurant, Homer checks out the lobster tank and chooses...
 the one floating upside-down at the top.

 Bart suffers through the Happy Little Elves...
   
   Bart: [watching a Happy Little Elves tape] Oh, man, I can't take it any more!
   Lisa: But I want to see what happens.
   Bart: You <know> what happens.  They find Captain Quick's treasure.
         All the elves dance around like little green idiots.  I puke.  The End.
   Lisa: Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.
   -- ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Bart switches to ``America's Most Armed and Dangerous'', though Lisa
 finds the show too scary.
   
   The Cue-ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous.
   If you think you've seen him, call 1-800-U-SQUEAL.
   -- ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 At the restaurant, the bubbly stops flowing, so Homer orders another bottle
 of their second-cheapest champagne.

 Back at the house...
   
   The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living
   room, while the bandit roamed the house at will,
   [TV pans over an empty house]
   stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for!
   -- Watching `America's Most Armed and Dangerous', ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 To the music of the Larry Davis Experience, Homer and Marge mambo divinely.

 Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa watch more of America's Most Armed and Dangerous,
 and as the description of the Babysitter Bandit continues, they become
 increasingly frightened.  ``In a moment, we will show you a picture of the
 real Babysitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski [pron.\ /botzokowsky/],
 and remember... she may be using a clever alias.''  A picture of Ms. Botz
 appears on the screen, and the kids scream.  Ms. Botz appears, carrying
 a length of rope.  Bart and Lisa scream,
 ``Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!''  Thunder roars outside.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 13:23]

 The kids make a run for it.  Bart ducks into the basement.  Lisa skids
 (cartoon style) into the kitchen and grabs the phone.  But she gets a
 busy signal.  Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are on the highway looking for
 Ye Olde Offramp Inn.  They spot it, but miss the exit.  ``No problemo,''
 says Homer.  ``We'll just get off at the next exit.''  A sign reads,
 ``Next Exit 34 Miles.''

 Ms. Botz descends into the basement looking for Bart.  While searching,
 she finds a cabinet of pickled beets and helps herself.  Atop the
 cabinet is Bart and a bowling ball.  Bart tries to roll the ball onto
 Ms. Botz, but he loses his balance and falls.
   
   Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
   -- Bart to The Babysitter Bandit, after a failed capture attempt,
      ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Meanwhile, Lisa hides under the kitchen table and finally gets through.
 As she talks, she is dragged by the phone cord out from under the table.
 By Ms. Botz.  Oops.

 Homer carries Marge across the threshold, stumbles, and trips, tossing
 Marge (``Wheeeee!!'') onto the waterbed, where she relaxes, while Homer
 rubs his knee.

 Back at home, Ms. Botz has finished tying up Bart and Lisa...
   
   Bart: We know who you are, Ms. Botz.  Or should I say, Ms. Botzcowski.
         You're the Babysitter Bandit.
   Ms.B: You're a smart young man, Bart.  I hope you're smart enough to keep
         your mouth shut.
   Lisa: He isn't.
   -- A little knowledge, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 ... disables the phones, tapes Bart's mouth shut, and leaves them on the
 couch to suffer through The Happy Little Elves.  Bart protests, but Lisa
 says, ``Quiet, Bart!  Let's make the best of this.''

 At the motel, Marge offers to go ``slip into something more comfortable'',
 and Homer hopes it's the blue thing with the... things.

 Maggie wakes up and grabs the mobile above her crib, which she uses as a
 trapeze, landing in a pile of stuffed animals.  She spots Ms. Botz in the
 hallway, relieving the closet of its valuables (and some unvaluables).
 Maggie then wanders downstairs and spots her elder siblings, as well as
 the Happy Little Elves.  She decides to watch the Elves.

 The movie ends, and Maggie tries to turn off the TV with the remote control.
 Lisa asks, ``Wanna watch the Happy Little Elves again?''  Maggie nods.
 ``But ya hafta untie me, first.''  Maggie does so.

 ``Oh... Homer...'' calls Marge seductively.  She's indeed wearing the blue
 thing with the... things.  Homer gives one of his lustful, ``Ohhhhh...''s.

 Ms. Botz continues her pillaging and spots Maggie walking through the
 hallway.  She follows the sound of the sucking, which leads her into
 a dark room.  (*whump*)  The lights come on.  Bart (sucking on Maggie's
 pacifier) has clobbered her with a baseball bat.

 Homer and Marge relax in the waterbed, and Marge decides to check up on
 things at home.  There is no answer because Bart, Lisa, and Maggie
 (clutching Bart's neck like a knapsack) have escaped out the window.
 The kids call from a pay phone.  (Bart goes down on all fours so Lisa
 can stand on his back to reach the phone.)
   
   Operator: Hello, vigilant viewer.  How may we help you?
   Lisa: We caught her!  We caught the Babysitter Bandit!  She's tied up
         at our house right now!
   Bart: Ask if there's a reward.
   Lisa: Is there a reward? ... [to Bart] If she's convicted, we get T-shirts.
   Bart: Yeah!
   -- Calling America's Most Armed and Dangerous, ``Some Enchanted Evening''
   
 Homer and Marge return home to find Ms. Botz bound and gagged, being forced
 to watch, yes, The Happy Little Elves.  Homer and Marge untie her and
 apologize profusely.  Ms. Botz's first words:  ``Please turn off the TV.''

 Homer helps Ms. Botz with her luggage (``Oh, these things are heavy!'')
 and pays her triple the rate, just so there are no hard feelings.
   
   Ms.Botz: Mr. Samson, can I give you a bit of advice?
   Homer:   Sure.
   Ms.Botz: Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.

   Marge: Was he angry?
   Homer: No.
   Marge: Was he rude?
   Homer: Okay, okay, it wasn't how he said it, either.
   -- It's the thought that counts, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 ``But the message was loud and clear:  Our family stinks.''
 Marge notes that Ned's been nothing but a perfect neighbor, and Homer
 latches onto the word `perfect' and decides to take a walk to calm down.

 Meanwhile, Ned also has difficulty sleeping.
   
   I drag him over here, he has a few beers...  You can't blame him for erupting.
   -- Ned Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Maude suggests she isn't the person Ned should be talking to.  So Ned
 calls Rev. Lovejoy.
   
   Mrs. Lovejoy: Honey, wake up.  Honey, it sounds like Ned Flanders is
                 having some sort of crisis.
   Rev. Lovejoy: Oh.  Probably stepped on a worm...
   -- Flanders calls in the middle of the night, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Ned:   I feel like I violated Matthew 19:19.
   Rev.L: Huh?
   Ned:   Love thy neighbor.
   Rev.L: Oh, Matthew <nineteen> nineteen, yeah, right, right.
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Rev. Lovejoy suggests, ``A gentle answer turneth away wrath,'' then
 immediately hangs up.  Ned sits down and writes a letter.

 Ned slips the letter under the Simpsons front door, and is startled by
 Homer, returning from his walk.  Ned apologetically gives Homer the
 letter and leaves.  Homer reads it... and laughs.

 At the breakfast table...
   
   Homer: [reading Ned's letter]  ``You are my brother.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [giggle]
   Homer: ``I love you.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [laugh]
   Homer: ``And yet, I feel a great sadness...'' [tries to stifle a giggle]
          ``... in my bosom.''
   Homer+Lisa+Bart: [finally lose it and laugh uproariously]
   -- Reading Ned's letter of apology, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Marge scolds them for laughing and excuses herself into the next room,
 where she giggles, then returns.

   -- Lisa, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Marge tries to restore order.
   
   Bosom.
   -- Bart, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Marge wishes that her family was as close as the Flanderses.  So Homer
 offers to take the family miniature golfing, followed by frosty chocolate
 milkshakes.
   
   Mm.  I <was> going to wash my hair...
   -- Marge, after Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing,
      ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Lisa:  And I'm studying for the math fair.
          If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.
   Homer: Too bad we don't live on a farm.
   -- Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Homer takes Bart and Maggie.

 Homer putts the ball into the center hole... which deposits the ball in
 the parking lot.  A passing car kicks the ball down the street.
   
   Play it where it lays, Homer.
   -- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Maggie wanders off and takes a free ride on the windmill.  Meanwhile,
 Homer struggles with a mechanical ape obstacle.
   
   Give up homeboy, there's a six stroke limit.
   -- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 The ball goes up the ramp... bangs off the ape's opening-and-closing
 mouth... and returns to the tee.  Homer hops angrily.  Ned and Todd
 stop by.
   
   Todd: Hi Bart!
   Bart: Get bent.
   -- friendly greetings at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Ned:   Oh say, you look like you were having a little trouble there.
   Homer: That shot is impossible!  Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it!
   -- at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Todd suggests playing more conservatively.  Go around, rather than through
 the obstacle, ``setting yourself up for an easy deuce.''  Todd does so,
 and manages to get a hole-in-one.

 They reach Ye End of Course.
   
   Bart:  Final score.  Bart, forty-one.  Homer... let's see...
          six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus...
   Homer: Never mind!
   -- leaving the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 They spot a sign for a miniature golf tournament.
   
   Todd:  Wow!  First prize fifty dollars!
   Bart:  Wow!  Free balloons for everyone who enters!
   -- A matter of perspective, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Ned:   So, my little Bartly, thinking of entering the tournament?
   Homer: Yeah, he's entering.
          And what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
   Bart:  I guess it's possible...
   Ned:   Hey hey, I like that confidence.
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Ned notes that Todd is a rather good player.
   
   Oh yeah?  Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins
   any day of the week!  C'mon boy!
   -- Homer tells off Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 At the soda fountain.
   
   Bart:   But Dad!  I've never won anything in my life!
   Homer:  Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this.  It is <not>
           okay to lose!
   -- The ghost of Vince Lombardi? ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 [End of Act One.  Time: 8:59]

   Okay, that didn't work.  This time, move your head and don't follow through.
   -- Homer giving putting advice, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Marge and Lisa watch disapprovingly from the house.

 Practice over, Bart returns to his room and tosses his putter carelessly
 aside.
   
   Homer: What are you doing!  That putter is to you what a bat is
          to a baseball player!  What a violin is... to the... the guy that...
          the violin guy!  Now c'mon!  Give your putter a name.
   Bart:  What?
   Homer: C'mon, give it a name.
   Bart:  Mister Putter.
   Homer: D'oh...  You wanna try a little harder son?  C'mon give it a girl's
          name.
   Bart:  Mom.
   Homer: Your putter's name is Charlene!
   Bart:  Why?
   Homer: It just is, that's why!  Now this, is a picture of your enemy,
          Todd Flanders.  Every day, I want you to spend fifteen minutes
          staring at it.  And concentrating on how much you hate him, and how
          glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him!
   Bart:  Who's Charlene?
   Homer: [raises the putter, about to wallop Bart with it]
          I'll show you who Charlene is!  Now start hating!
   Bart:  Grrrrrrrr... rrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!  [loses enthusiasm]
   -- a pep talk, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Todd says hello from his room.

 Homer raids the fridge.
   
   Marge: Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.
   Homer: And?
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Marge: I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little
          kiddie golf tournament.
   Homer: But Marge, but this is our big chance to show up the Flandereses. [sic]
   Marge: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
   Homer: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by
          making someone else look bad.  And I'm tired of making other people feel
          good about themselves!
   -- Marge concerned over Homer's tactics, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Bart surveys his less-than-impressive awards shelf.
   
   Bart: Hey Lis, whaddya call those guys in chess that don't matter.
   Lisa: Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're
         referring to a pawn.
   Bart: Right.  I am a pawn.
   Lisa: Hmm... I know.  It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little
         to no interest in almost everything I do.
         Bart, I think I can help you.
   -- Lisa offers some sisterly advice, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 ``Our journey begins here at the library.''  She greets everyone, then
 heads for the card catalog.

   `Japanese obsession with'...  Ah, here it is... `Putting'.
   -- Lisa, looking through card catalog under `Golf', ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Bart: Lisa, we can't afford all these books!
   Lisa: Bart, we're just gonna borrow them.
   Bart: Oh... heh, heh... gotcha!  [wink]
   -- in the library, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 As haunting music plays, Bart and Lisa sit in the lotus position
 alongside a lake.
   
   Lisa: I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
   Bart: Okay.
   Lisa: Embrace nothingness.
   Bart: You got it.
   Lisa: Become like an uncarved stone.
   Bart: Done.
   Lisa: Bart, you're just pretending to know what I'm talking about!
   Bart: True.
   Lisa: Well, it's very frustrating!
   Bart: I'll bet.
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Lisa and Bart sit atop a mountain.
   
   Lisa: What is the sound of one hand clapping?
   Bart: Piece of cake.  [claps with one hand]
   Lisa: No, Bart, it's a 3000-year-old riddle with no anwer.
         It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.
   Bart: No answer?  Lisa, listen up!  [claps with one hand]
   -- Solving unsolved problems, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Lisa tries again.
   
   Lisa: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
   Bart: Absolutely!  [makes the sound of a tree falling]
   Lisa: But Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it.
   Bart: Wooooooo...
   Lisa: [hands Bart his putter] It is time.
   -- Bart finally gets it, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 At the miniature golf course, Lisa takes out a measuring tape.
   
   Lisa: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry.  All you have
         to do is hit the ball... here.
         [Tap] [Clunk-clunk] [Clunk-clunk] [Duh-dunk]
   Bart: I can't believe it.
         You've actually found a practical use for geometry!
   -- at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Bart sinks several more putts.  Lisa holds an umbrella over Bart as he
 putts.  The course rained out, they practice on a pool table.  Back at
 the course, Bart sinks a putt blindfolded and standing on one leg.
 Bart poses on the garbage can in the backyard.  Homer tells him to stop
 before the neighbors see, but too late.  Ned asks what's up, and Homer
 promises that Bart will mop the floor with Todd's butt.
   
   Ned:   May the best man win.
   Homer: ``May the best man win.''  The mating call of the loser!
   -- From one who should know, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Homer dares Ned to bet on the outcome, so Ned offers to wager one of Maude's
 wind chimes against a batch of Marge's blueberry muffins.  Homer asks Ned
 to make a ``real'' bet and makes chicken sounds for quite a long time.
   
   Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
   -- Ned Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Yelling at the top of their lungs, the two agree to make the father of the
 loser mow the winner's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.  Marge reluctantly
 draws up the terms of the agreement.  Ned suggests they phrase the bet as
 ``the father of the boy who doesn't win'' to avoid hurt feelings.  Marge
 writes up the bet and asks, ``I hope blood won't be necessary.''  Once
 Ned steps outside, he asks himself, ``Good gravy, what have I done?''

 Homer, Bart, and Lisa are at the miniature golf course yet again.
   
   Homer: Keep your left arm straight, Bart!  Rotate your shoulders!
   Lisa+Bart: Daaaad!
   Homer: Look son, all I'm asking is that you try.
   Bart:  Ok, I'll try.
   Homer: D'oh!  Anybody can try!  I want you to <win>!
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Bart swats at the ball, which bounces off an obstacle and careens back
 towards Homer, who ducks out of the way.

 Homer fishes through the closet.  He holds up two of Marge's dresses.
 ``Give me your honest opinion.  This... or this?''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 15:15]

 Homer stands vigil over Bart's bed.  Bart wakes up, sees Homer, and
 screams.  Homer gently reminds Bart that today is the day of the
 tournament, and less gently threatens Bart that he'd better win.
 Downstairs, Marge prepares a breakfast of steak and eggs.
 Homer reads the paper...
   
   Heh heh heh.  That crazy Marmaduke.
   -- Homer reads the morning paper, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 ... while Lisa drills Bart one last time.
   
   Lisa: Eighth hole.
   Bart: Aim for the octopus, third tentacle.
   Lisa: Twelfth hole.
   Bart: Bank it off the pink tombstone.
   Lisa: Nirvanha.
   Bart: A state of bliss obtained through the extinction of the self.
   -- pre-game drills, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Lisa refuses to let Bart eat steak and eggs.  Bart is on a strict diet
 of complex carbohydrates; steak will make him logey.  Lisa suggests a
 breakfast of oatmeal.
   
   Lisa:  Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she
          wins the Kentucky Derby.
   Homer: Newsflash, Lisa, Bart is not a horse!

 ``Eat your steak, boy.''

 Tournament preparations are complete.
   
   Good afternoon everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been
   a stirring afternoon of miniature golf.  The cream has risen.  The
   wheat has bid farewell to the chaff.  And now, we approach the
   championship match where but two warriors remain:  The heretofore
   unknown Bart Simpson and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled
   ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.
   -- K.B.B.L. announcer, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Lisa: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself,
         I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound.  But here goes.
         I believe in you.
   Bart: Thanks, man.
   -- pre-game pep talk, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
   Hey Flanders, it's no use praying.  I already did the same thing, and
   we can't <both> win.
   -- Homer, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Ned explains that they were merely praying that no one gets hurt.
 (At a golf tournament?)
   
   Homer: This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels!
   Ned:   Nope, <you> will.
   Homer: 'Fraid not.
   Ned:   'Fraid so!
   Homer: 'Fraid not.
   Ned:   'Fraid so!
   Homer: 'Fraid not infinity!
   Ned:   'Fraid so infinity plus one!
   Homer: D'oh!
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Todd tees of first and sinks a hole-in-one.  Bart says to himself, ``Tree
 falling in the woods...  Tree falling in the woods...  Tree falling in
 the...''  He putts without looking.  And sinks a hole-in-one.

 The battle continues to the final hole.
   
   If one looks up courage in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very
   well come upon a photo of these two gladiators.  They approach the final
   hole in the shadow of the Great Emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes
   on the happy side of par.  Soon, one man will emerge triumphant; he will
   drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in
   this oft cruel game.
   -- ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 Todd's putt lands a few feet from the hole.  Next up is Bart.
   
   Homer: Remember what Vince Lombardi said:
          If you lose you're out of the family!
   Marge: Homer!  [slap]
   Homer: Ow.
   -- words of encouragement during the golf match, ``Dead Putting Society''
   
 The ball heads for the obstacle.  All gasp as it appears it won't make
 it through.  Then all breathe a sigh of relief when it does.  Bart's
 ball lands about the same distance from the hole as Todd's.
   
   Bart: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd.
   Todd: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I got butterflies in my stomach...
         But I guess this builds character.
   Bart: Who wants to build character?  Let's quit!
   Todd: Okay.

   Homer: Wait a minute.  That word you keep calling me?

 in the living room.
   
   Homer:  You said you'd go the prom with me.
   Marge:  I also said I hated you, and we haven't even talked since then.
   Homer:  I was afraid you'd cancel our date, so I stayed away from

           for three weeks and graduating this summer.  I hope.

   Homer: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.  But I thought she was the one that didn't like
          to be ... you know ... touched.
   Marge: It's Patty who chose a life of celibacy.  Selma simply had celibacy
          thrust upon her.

 invites him to dinner to pay him back for all the crummy things Bart has
 done to the school.  He accepts.  In the background, Bart slaps his
 forehead.  Homer says, ``Excellent...'' and does that funny thing
 with his fingers.

 Principal Skinner arrives at the Simpson residence, and the Bouvier twins
 watch nervously from the kitchen.  Skinner tells Homer that he hopes the
 dinner isn't a scheme to introduce him to a woman, but he never finishes
 his sentence.  He sees Patty.

 as it's her first in 25 years.
